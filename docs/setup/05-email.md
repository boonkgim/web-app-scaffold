# Slice 5 — Email: Resend and React Email

Horizontal. Three pipelines have never run: React Email rendering under workerd, an outbound
third-party API call from a Worker, and the first secret delivered by `wrangler secret put`.

A verification mail you cannot send is not a gate, so this groundwork comes before a layer
that would need to send one.

## Preflight

```bash
grep -l RESEND_API_KEY apps/graphql/.env* 2>/dev/null    # key already on this machine?
```

The account and key block **Round 2 only** — local rendering sends nothing and needs neither.
`USER-SETUP.md` has the signup, the scope the key needs, and the shared-sender limit that
decides who can receive.

**What the probes returned here, 2026-09-06.** No `RESEND_API_KEY` on this machine. Node
v24.18.0, pnpm 11.15.1. `wrangler whoami` logged in as you@example.com with five accounts —
already settled, since `apps/graphql/.env.production` carries the account id Slice 1 chose. The
account exists and its signup address is you@example.com, which is what
`MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS` is set to throughout this file.

## What research found, 2026-09-06

Every pin below was read from the registry the day this plan was written, not inherited from
the reference. Two of the reference's claims are load-bearing and both still hold:

| Package                   | Resolved | Deprecated?                        |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `react-email`             | 6.9.3    | no                                 |
| `resend`                  | 6.26.0   | no                                 |
| `@react-email/ui`         | 6.9.3    | no                                 |
| `@react-email/components` | 1.0.12   | **yes** — "Package no longer supported." |
| `@react-email/render`     | 2.1.0    | no, but nothing needs it named     |

So the one-package install below is right, and the trap it warns about is live rather than
historical: installing `@react-email/components` today still succeeds, still exports every name
used here, and still typechecks. The deprecation line in `pnpm add`'s output is the only
signal.

Three further checks, because the reference is explicit that its own version numbers are claims
rather than facts:

- **`react-email` exports one root entry** (`./dist/index.mjs`, with `import`/`require`
  conditions and no `workerd` one) and depends on `@react-email/render >=2.1.0`. That is the
  re-export the slice relies on, confirmed from the package metadata rather than from prose.
  Its peer range is `react: ^18.0 || ^19.0`, which 19.2.8 satisfies.
- **The current docs import both halves from `react-email`** — `import { Button } from "react-email"`
  and `import { render, pretty } from "react-email"`, with `plainText` still an option on
  `render`. The code blocks below need no adjustment.
- **`email dev` still takes `--dir` and `--port`**, and still defaults to port 3000 — which is
  why `email:dev` names 3001, since `next dev` holds 3000.

`react` and `react-dom` are already at exactly **19.2.8** in `apps/web`, the versions the
catalog block below adds, so this repo needs no version reconciliation — only the move into the
catalog.

Two edits were made to this plan for this repo, both anchoring hunks on what is actually on
disk rather than what the reference assumed: the catalog block's `eslint` line reads `^10.10.0`
here, and the `CLAUDE.md` hunk is rewritten for a bullet list. Both are noted where they appear.

## Decisions

| Decision                                                                       | Why                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/email`, not a directory in `apps/graphql`                            | JSX config, React deps, and the preview server want their own root. Slice 2's one-importer objection was about a re-export; this is a toolchain boundary.                         |
| Resend                                                                         | HTTP API, no SMTP connection to hold open from an isolate.                                                                                                                        |
| Everything — components, `render`, the CLI — from one `react-email` dependency | Since `react-email@6` that package _is_ the library; `@react-email/components` and the per-component packages are deprecated. Verify this has not moved again before you install. |
| Render to **html and text**, not `react:` passthrough                          | Resend can render a component itself, but then the `log` transport has nothing to show and there is no plain-text alternative.                                                    |
| Transport named by `MAIL_TRANSPORT`, fail-closed                               | `log` locally and in tests, `resend` in production. Unset is an error, so production cannot silently stop sending.                                                                |
| `sendTestEmail` mutation, allowlisted                                          | The slice needs something to observe in production. `MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS` fails closed like `CORS_ORIGINS`.                                                                      |

`react` and `react-dom` move into the workspace catalog here: `apps/web` and `packages/email`
both install them, which is the rule as written.

## packages/email

```bash
mkdir -p packages/email && cd packages/email && pnpm init
pnpm pkg set name="@cc4-test/email"
pnpm pkg set exports="./src/index.ts"
pnpm pkg delete main
pnpm add resend react-email
pnpm add -D @react-email/ui @types/react vitest typescript@catalog:
pnpm pkg set \
  scripts.typecheck="tsc --noEmit" \
  scripts.lint="eslint . --max-warnings 0" \
  scripts.format="prettier --write . --ignore-path ../../.gitignore --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore" \
  scripts.test="vitest run" \
  'scripts["test:unit"]=vitest run --project unit' \
  'scripts["test:integration"]=vitest run --project integration' \
  'scripts["email:dev"]=email dev --dir emails --port 3001'
```

(Two `--ignore-path`s, not one. `--ignore-path` _replaces_ prettier's default ignore
list rather than adding to it, and that default is `.gitignore` — so the single-flag
form switches gitignore-based exclusion off and `pnpm format` reformats build output.
Slice 0 states the rule and Slice 1 is where it was discovered; this line is one of the
sibling commands that kept the pre-correction form until 2026-08-31.)

**`react-email` is a runtime dependency, and there is no separate components package.** Until
`react-email@6.0.0` (2026-04-16) this slice installed three packages —
`@react-email/components` and `@react-email/render` at runtime, `react-email` as a dev-only
CLI — and that was right at the time. v6 moved every component and the rendering utilities
**into** `react-email` and deprecated what they came from. `@react-email/render` and
`@react-email/ui` are the only survivors, and `react-email` re-exports the former, so nothing
needs it named.

The trap is that **nothing fails**. The deprecated packages still install, still export the
same names, and every code block below compiles against either shape — so a slice run from a
stale reference produces a working, green, quietly-unmaintained tree. What gives it away is a
single line of install output:

```
[WARN] deprecated @react-email/components@1.0.12: Package no longer supported.
```

That is the general lesson, not the specific version: **§3 must read what `pnpm add` prints,
not just its exit code.** A deprecation notice is the only signal a moved package gives when
its API did not move with it.

Pulling the CLI into `dependencies` looks alarming, because its own dependencies include
esbuild, chokidar, socket.io, prismjs and tailwindcss. It costs nothing at runtime: those are
reachable only from `dist/cli/index.mjs`, and the Worker imports the package's main entry,
which is the components plus a re-export of the renderer. esbuild's native binary is installed
(Slice 0's `allowBuilds` already permits it) and never bundled. The production gate's bundle
figures are the check on that claim, and they came in within 1% of what the three-package
split measured — which is the evidence, not the reasoning.

The merge does not carry over an export map: `react-email` declares plain `import`/`require`
with no `workerd` condition. That is fine, and was equally true of `@react-email/components` —
the condition that matters lives on `@react-email/render`'s own `package.json` and is honoured
when the re-export resolves it, whichever package points there.

Port 3001, because `email dev` defaults to 3000 and `next dev` is already there. The flag is a preference, not a
reservation: the CLI takes the next free port and says so (`Port 3001 is already in use,
trying 3002`), which is what happens on a machine already previewing another project's
templates. The gate row reads the port off the output, not off this line.

`@react-email/ui` is the preview server's own interface, and `email dev` does not ship it:
without it the CLI stops on a `Would you like to install it? (Y/n)` prompt, which on a machine
with no TTY — CI, or a command run by an agent — is not a prompt but a silent exit. Declaring
it makes the gate row runnable anywhere. It is a dev dependency of the preview tool only;
nothing under `src` imports it.

```bash
cat > tsconfig.json <<'EOF'
{
  "extends": "../../packages/config/tsconfig.base.json",
  // Templates are React components, so JSX has to compile. react-jsx needs no React
  // import in scope. skipLibCheck for the same reason apps/graphql needs it: the
  // renderer's types reach react-dom/server, which force-loads the DOM lib.
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src", "emails"]
}
EOF
cat > eslint.config.mjs <<'EOF'
import base from "../../packages/config/eslint.base.mjs";

export default [...base];
EOF
cat > vitest.config.ts <<'EOF'
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    passWithNoTests: true,
    projects: [
      {
        test: {
          name: "unit",
          include: ["src/**/*.test.ts"],
          exclude: ["**/*.int.test.ts"],
        },
      },
      {
        test: {
          name: "integration",
          include: ["src/**/*.int.test.ts"],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
EOF
```

The `react-email` CLI has a build directory no slice created: `email build` and `email export`
copy a Next.js app into `.react-email/` at the project root and work from there. **`email dev`
does not** — v6 packs the preview server into `$HOME/.react-email` instead, and running the
gate row leaves the working tree untouched. So this is insurance, not a fix: the two commands
that fill the directory are one word away from the one `email:dev` runs, and nothing about the
script announces which you are about to type. Left unignored it costs a few thousand generated
files reformatted by `pnpm format`, linted by `pnpm lint`, and offered up by `git status`.
`.gitignore` is also what keeps prettier off it (`--ignore-path ../../.gitignore`):

```diff
--- .gitignore
 node_modules/
 .next
 .open-next
 .turbo
 .wrangler
+# `email build` / `email export` copy a Next.js app in here. Build output, not source.
+.react-email
 .cache
 .env*
 !.env.example
```

`.gitignore` does not settle it for ESLint, which is why the other build directories are
listed twice: flat config reads no ignore file, so the shared base carries its own copy of
that list. `.react-email` belongs in both or `pnpm lint` walks it:

```diff
--- packages/config/eslint.base.mjs
       "**/.turbo/**",
       "**/.wrangler/**",
+      // The react-email CLI's build directory — a generated Next.js app, see Slice 5.
+      "**/.react-email/**",
       "**/dist/**",
```

`tsconfig.json` needs no equivalent: this package's `include` names `src` and `emails`, so
`tsc` never sees the directory in the first place.

The catalog gains `react` and `react-dom`, pinned at the exact versions Next chose — a range
here would let the two packages resolve differently and render with two React copies:

```diff
--- pnpm-workspace.yaml
 # Track the newest release of the Node major this repo runs, not npm's `latest`:
 # @types/node ships majors for Node versions you are not on.
+#
+# react/react-dom are exact, not ranged: apps/web takes what Next pinned and
+# packages/email must match it. Two resolutions means two React copies, which
+# renders nothing and explains nothing.
 catalog:
   typescript: ^6.0.3
   eslint: ^10.10.0
   "@types/node": ^24.13.3
+  react: 19.2.8
+  react-dom: 19.2.8
```

Only then can anything ask for `react@catalog:` — a catalog specifier resolves at install
time, so the entry has to exist before the install that names it:

```bash
cd ../../apps/web
pnpm pkg set dependencies.react="catalog:" 'dependencies["react-dom"]=catalog:'
cd ../../packages/email
pnpm add react@catalog: react-dom@catalog:
```

The bracket form is not a style choice: `pnpm pkg set` reads a dot path, and a hyphen in a
segment is a parse error rather than a key — `dependencies.react-dom=` fails outright, and it
fails after `dependencies.react` has already been written.

### The template

Written now; a real token is wired in only once a verified sign-up layer exists to issue one.

```bash
mkdir -p emails
cat > emails/verify-email.tsx <<'EOF'
import {
  Body,
  Button,
  Container,
  Head,
  Heading,
  Html,
  Preview,
  Text,
} from "react-email";

export interface VerifyEmailProps {
  url: string;
}

// Inline styles only. Email clients strip or ignore <style> blocks unpredictably, and
// there is no cascade to rely on — this is the one place in the repo where naming a
// colour is correct, because theme.css does not reach a mail client.
const main = { backgroundColor: "#ffffff", fontFamily: "sans-serif" };
const container = { margin: "0 auto", padding: "24px", maxWidth: "480px" };
const button = {
  backgroundColor: "#18181b",
  color: "#ffffff",
  borderRadius: "6px",
  padding: "10px 16px",
  fontSize: "14px",
  textDecoration: "none",
  display: "inline-block",
};
const muted = { color: "#71717a", fontSize: "12px" };

export function VerifyEmail({ url }: VerifyEmailProps) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      {/* The inbox line under the subject. Without it clients scrape the first text
          they find, which is usually the heading repeated. */}
      <Preview>Confirm your cc4-test email address</Preview>
      <Body style={main}>
        <Container style={container}>
          <Heading>Confirm your email</Heading>
          <Text>Click the button to confirm this address for cc4-test.</Text>
          <Button href={url} style={button}>
            Confirm email
          </Button>
          {/* The bare URL is not decoration: a client that blocks the button leaves
              the recipient with no way through, and the text alternative needs it. */}
          <Text style={muted}>Or paste this into your browser: {url}</Text>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}

// `email dev` renders the default export, with PreviewProps as its sample data.

export interface RenderedEmail {
  subject: string;
  html: string;
  text: string;
}

// Two passes, because `render` returns one format per call. The text alternative is
// not optional politeness: a message without one is scored as spam by most filters,
// and a client with images and HTML off shows an empty body.
export async function renderVerifyEmail(url: string): Promise<RenderedEmail> {
  const element = <VerifyEmail url={url} />;

  return {
    // The subject lives here rather than in the template: a React component renders a
    // body, and a subject is a header. Keeping them in one function is what stops a
    // template being sent with someone else's subject.

## apps/graphql

```bash
cd ../../apps/graphql
pnpm add @cc4-test/email@workspace:*
```

The package's `exports` is `./src/index.ts` — source, not a build — so importing it hands this
app a `.tsx` file to compile, and `tsc` refuses with `--jsx is not set` about a file no one
here wrote. The flag belongs to the consumer because the compilation does:

```diff
--- apps/graphql/tsconfig.json
   // in this workspace today and would break on a clean or hoisting-free install.
+  //
+  // jsx is here for a package this app does not itself write JSX in. @cc4-test/email
+  // exports TypeScript source, not a build, so its render.tsx is compiled by whoever
+  // imports it — and `--jsx is not set` is what tsc says about a file it was handed
+  // rather than one it was asked for. The Worker bundle is unaffected either way;
+  // esbuild reads the extension.
   "compilerOptions": {
     "skipLibCheck": true,
+    "jsx": "react-jsx",
     "types": ["node"]
   },

Three vars and a secret. `wrangler.jsonc` by hand, as always — the file carries an
account-specific Hyperdrive id:

```jsonc
{
  ...,
  "vars": {
    ...,
    "MAIL_FROM": "cc4-test <onboarding@resend.dev>",
    "MAIL_TRANSPORT": "resend",
    // Who sendTestEmail may write to. Fail-closed, like CORS_ORIGINS: an empty list
    // refuses everything, so a public mutation cannot become an open relay.
    "MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS": "you@example.com"
  }
}
```

Local overrides go in `.env.development` by hand — it is gitignored and now holds a
credential, so the doc stops owning it whole:

```ini
MAIL_TRANSPORT=log
MAIL_FROM="cc4-test <onboarding@resend.dev>"
MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS=you@example.com
# Only needed while you flip MAIL_TRANSPORT to resend for the real-send gate row.
# RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
```

**Written commented out, which the reference leaves live.** `MAIL_TRANSPORT=log` means nothing
reads the key, so a live `re_...` line is a placeholder that looks like a credential — it
survives a `grep RESEND_API_KEY`, which is precisely this slice's own preflight probe, and
would have reported a key on a machine that has none. Commented, the line still tells you where
the key goes without lying to the probe that looks for it.

Slice 2 wrote that file whole; from here nobody can. A heredoc would either overwrite your
real key or commit one, so this slice appends a fragment and hands the file back — which is
drift the checker cannot distinguish from the real thing, and so takes a **permanent** line in
`scripts/docs-check.ignore`, added by hand beside `wrangler.jsonc`'s and for the same reason:

```diff
--- scripts/docs-check.ignore
 apps/graphql/wrangler.jsonc  # permanent: vars are added by hand, never whole-file
+
+# Permanent, and for the same reason as the line above: from Slice 5 this file holds
+# RESEND_API_KEY, so no doc can ever write it whole again — a heredoc would either
+# overwrite your real key or commit one. Slice 2 wrote it; Slice 5 appends a fragment
+# and hands it back. Nothing to delete when a later slice lands.
+apps/graphql/.env.development  # permanent: gitignored and holds secrets, appended by hand
```

**A `diff` hunk, not a plain fence, and it needs a context line.** `docs:check` composes a
file's expected contents from the last `cat >` heredoc plus every `diff` hunk after it, and
ignores any other fence — so a fenced listing of the line to add reads as prose, and the file
drifts by exactly the line it was supposed to document. A hunk of nothing but `+` lines is
rejected too (`hunk has no context or removed lines to anchor on`); `wrangler.jsonc`'s
baseline from Slice 2 is the context line that anchors this one to the end of the file.

Nothing to delete when a later slice lands — no doc will own this file whole again, and one
that tried would be wrong.

```diff
--- apps/graphql/.env.example
 CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
 APP_ENV=local
+# log renders and prints; resend actually sends. Unset is an error, never a fallback.
+MAIL_TRANSPORT=log
+MAIL_FROM=cc4-test <onboarding@resend.dev>
+MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS=you@example.com
+# The one key with no counterpart in wrangler.jsonc. Secrets are set with
+# `wrangler secret put` and stored by Cloudflare; a `vars` entry would be plaintext.
+RESEND_API_KEY=re_dev_only_not_a_real_key
```

```bash
pnpm cf-typegen
```

### The allowlist

```bash
cat > src/mail.ts <<'EOF'
import type { Env } from "./context";

/** Who sendTestEmail may write to.
 *
 *  Fail closed on an unset or empty list, the same shape as cors.ts: this mutation has no
 *  session layer to gate it against yet, and a send-to-anyone mutation on a public endpoint
 *  is an open relay. An empty list refusing everything is the safe reading of a var someone
 *  forgot.
 */
export function isAllowedRecipient(env: Env, to: string): boolean {
  const allowed = (env.MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS ?? "")
    .split(",")
    .map((address) => address.trim().toLowerCase())
    .filter(Boolean);

  return allowed.includes(to.trim().toLowerCase());
}
EOF
cat > src/mail.test.ts <<'EOF'
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { isAllowedRecipient } from "./mail";
import type { Env } from "./context";

const envWith = (list?: string) =>
  ({ MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS: list }) as unknown as Env;

test("an address on the list is allowed, case and spacing insensitive", () => {
  const env = envWith(" A@example.test , b@example.test ");

  expect(isAllowedRecipient(env, "a@EXAMPLE.test")).toBe(true);
  expect(isAllowedRecipient(env, "b@example.test")).toBe(true);
});

test("an address off the list is refused", () => {
  expect(isAllowedRecipient(envWith("a@example.test"), "c@example.test")).toBe(
    false,
  );
});

// The trap: an empty list must mean "nobody", not "no restriction".
test("an unset list refuses everything", () => {
  expect(isAllowedRecipient(envWith(undefined), "a@example.test")).toBe(false);
  expect(isAllowedRecipient(envWith(""), "a@example.test")).toBe(false);
});
EOF
```

### The mutation

The schema's first `Mutation` type. Same module rule as ever — a new directory, not a line in
someone else's:

```bash
mkdir -p src/schema/mail
cat > src/schema/mail/schema.graphql <<'EOF'
type Mutation {
  """
  Sends the verification template to an address on MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS.
  Exists to prove the mail pipeline in production; not part of any feature.
  """
  sendTestEmail(to: String!): Boolean!
}
EOF
pnpm turbo codegen --filter @cc4-test/graphql
```

The preset scaffolds under `resolvers/Mutation/` exactly as it does for `Query` — root fields
are root fields.

```bash
cat > src/schema/mail/resolvers/Mutation/sendTestEmail.ts <<'EOF'
import { createMailer, renderVerifyEmail } from "@cc4-test/email";
import { GraphQLError } from "graphql";
import { isAllowedRecipient } from "./../../../../mail";
import type { MutationResolvers } from "./../../../types.generated";

export const sendTestEmail: NonNullable<
  MutationResolvers["sendTestEmail"]
> = async (_parent, { to }, ctx) => {
  if (!isAllowedRecipient(ctx, to)) {
    throw new GraphQLError("Recipient is not in MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS");
  }

  // A placeholder link, because nothing in this slice issues real tokens. What is
  // being proven is the pipeline, not the URL.
  const message = await renderVerifyEmail(
    "https://cc4-test.example/api/auth/verify-email?token=slice-7",
  );
  await createMailer(ctx).send({ to, ...message });

  return true;
};
EOF
```

`createMailer(ctx)` typechecks because `MailEnv` is declared structurally — **not** because
`WorkerEnv` carries all three keys. It carries two. `pnpm cf-typegen` generates `WorkerEnv`
from `wrangler.jsonc` plus the env file, and `RESEND_API_KEY` is in neither: it is a secret,
stored at Cloudflare by `wrangler secret put`, so nothing wrangler reads knows its name. The
generated interface here is exactly `HYPERDRIVE`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `APP_ENV`, `MAIL_FROM`,
`MAIL_TRANSPORT`, `MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS` — and the call compiles because `MailEnv` declares
`RESEND_API_KEY?: string`, optional.

That is the right shape and worth understanding rather than fixing: a secret cannot be
statically proven present, so `createMailer`'s `if (!key) throw` is the only thing standing
between a missing secret and a silent no-op. Widening `WorkerEnv` by hand to include it would
buy a compile-time guarantee that is not true at runtime.

## Local gate

```bash
cd ../..
```

**Two rounds, and they are not interchangeable.** The first is scriptable and belongs to
whoever is building the slice. The second is a person looking at something no assertion
covers — a rendered template, an inbox, a plain-text part. Naming them separately is what
stops the manual half being quietly skipped because the automated half went green, and it is
what tells the person which rows are actually theirs.

### Round 1 — automated

| Where          | Check                            | Expect                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| root           | `pnpm typecheck`                 | pass                                              |
| root           | **`pnpm lint`**                  | **`6 successful`** — 4 lint + 2 `codegen` (was 5) |
| root           | **`pnpm test:unit`**             | **`Tests 30 passed`** — 20 + email 7 + graphql 3  |
| root           | **`pnpm test:integration`**      | **`Tests 2 passed`** — unchanged                  |
| root           | `pnpm docs:check`                | no drift                                          |
| `apps/graphql` | `pnpm wrangler deploy --dry-run` | bundles, and reports the upload size              |

**30, not the 32 the reference names.** The reference carries slice 4's total of 22 as this
slice's baseline; in _this_ repo slice 4 ended at 20, because `packages/db` has an integration
test and no unit test at all — `pnpm --filter @cc4-test/db test:unit` finds no files and exits
0 under `passWithNoTests`. The number this slice is actually accountable for is the **delta**,
and that is unchanged: **+7 in `packages/email`** (3 render, 4 mailer) and **+3 in
`apps/graphql`** (the allowlist). An absolute total is a fact about one repo; the delta is the
fact about the slice. Read the per-package lines, not the sum, if the two ever disagree again.

### Round 2 — driven, not described

**All three rows were driven by the agent on 2026-09-06, and none of them needed a person.**
They were written as "manual, every row is one click"; the click was the wrong unit, because the
decisive evidence in two of them is a *count*. The pre-filled GraphiQL links below are kept for
poking at it by hand, but the pass was established with `curl` and `grep -c`.

Start `pnpm dev` in `apps/graphql` first — it serves on `:8787`. Yoga ships GraphiQL on
`GET /graphql`, and GraphiQL reads `?query=` straight into its editor, so a link can arrive
**pre-filled and unrun**: press play, and nothing fires on load. Each distinct query opens its
own GraphiQL tab, so several such links do not overwrite each other.

**Write these links into the plan with the address already substituted.** A manual row that
makes the reader hand-write a mutation is a row that gets skipped or mistyped, and this is the
round where a mistyped recipient means testing nothing. `encodeURIComponent` the query; the
`Accept` header a browser sends is what selects GraphiQL over the JSON endpoint, so the same
URL under `curl` returns `405` unless you pass `-H 'accept: text/html'`.

| Open                                                                                                                                                         | Expect                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm email:dev` in `packages/email`, then the port it prints                                                                                                | the template renders; `</>` gives a Plain Text tab carrying the link              |
| [send to an allowed address](http://localhost:8787/graphql?query=mutation%20%7B%20sendTestEmail(to%3A%20%22you%40example.com%22)%20%7D) | `{"data":{"sendTestEmail":true}}`, and one `[mail:log]` line in the Worker output |
| [send to an address off the list](http://localhost:8787/graphql?query=mutation%20%7B%20sendTestEmail%28to%3A%20%22nobody%40example.com%22%29%20%7D)          | an error, and **no** log line                                                     |

The third row is the reason this round exists. An allowlist that logs the refusal _after_
sending is the failure that looks fine in every test checking only the return value — and it
looks fine in row two as well. Only the absence of a second log line disproves it.

**So count the log lines; do not look at them.** "No new line appeared" is what a person skims
past, and the row turns on it. What this repo actually recorded:

| Step                              | Response                                          | `[mail:log]` lines |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| before                            | —                                                 | 0                  |
| `sendTestEmail(to: "you@example.com")`   | `{"data":{"sendTestEmail":true}}`                 | 1                  |
| `sendTestEmail(to: "nobody@…")`   | `Recipient is not in MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS`        | **1** — unchanged  |

Two sends, one log line. Two sends and two log lines would be the bug, and it is invisible in
both mutation responses.

The template row was driven in the browser: `verify-email` renders with its heading, the dark
button and the bare-URL fallback, and the `</>` → **Plain Text** tab carries the link twice —
once from the button, once from the fallback paragraph. Two claims in this slice were confirmed
in passing: `email dev` started without stopping on the `@react-email/ui` install prompt, which
is why that dev dependency is declared; and it created **no `.react-email` directory in the
working tree**, so `git status` stayed clean — v6 packs the preview app into `$HOME` and the
`.gitignore` entry really is insurance against `email build`/`export`, not a fix for `dev`.

**The real-send row lives in the production gate, not here.** Flipping
`MAIL_TRANSPORT=resend` locally proves the same pipeline against the same API, so running it
at both ends spends money twice for one piece of evidence. If you do want it locally, the key
goes into `.env.development` by hand — see the fragment above — and goes back to `log`
afterwards, or `pnpm dev` sends real mail for the rest of the slice.

**Nothing in `test:integration` sends mail.** A test that hit Resend would cost money, need a
network, and deliver to a real inbox on every CI run. The transport split is what buys the
coverage instead: the unit tests assert the exact payload against a mocked SDK, and the one
real send is a gate row a human performs.

## Production gate

Steps 1–3 run once per account. Steps 4–6 are the gate and re-run on every later deploy that
touches mail.

Every command below runs in `apps/graphql`, and each step repeats the `cd` rather than
relying on one at the top. `wrangler` is a devDependency of that package, so from the root
`pnpm wrangler` fails with `Command "wrangler" not found`; and wrangler reads `wrangler.jsonc`
from the working directory, so the directory is what decides which Worker a secret attaches
to. A `cd` a reader can scroll past is a wrong-Worker secret waiting to happen.

### 1. Resend account and API key — one time

`USER-SETUP.md` §1–3: the signup, the sending-access scope, and the shared-sender limit that
decides who can actually receive. Nothing here is the agent's to do.

### 2. `MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS` — one time

`wrangler.jsonc` ships the slice author's address. Change it to yours or step 5 refuses your
own send:

```jsonc
"MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS": "you@example.com"
```

A `var`, so it takes a redeploy — do it before step 4. Not a secret: the list is not
sensitive, and `src/mail.ts` failing closed is what makes it safe.

### 3. The secret — one time, again only to rotate

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY   # paste the key at the prompt
```

Interactive because the key is never a file, a flag, or a `vars` entry. Cloudflare stores it
against the Worker and **`wrangler deploy` does not clear it** — do not re-run this before
each deploy. `pnpm wrangler secret list` confirms it without revealing it.

### 4. Deploy — re-runnable

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler deploy --dry-run
pnpm deploy:production
```

`apps/web` is untouched and does not redeploy. Idempotent; the step 3 secret survives.

The dry run reports the bundle, which this slice moves most: roughly 2576 KiB raw and 521 KiB
gzipped, about four times what preceded it. Cloudflare enforces the gzipped figure against
3 MiB on the free plan, so there is room — but React Email roughly doubled the upload for one
template, so measure the next addition.

That figure is also the check on taking `react-email` as a runtime dependency: it lands within
1% of what the three-package split measured before v6, which is the evidence that the CLI's
own esbuild/chokidar/socket.io/tailwindcss dependencies stay behind an entry point the Worker
never imports. Had they been reachable, the number would not be close.

### 5. Observe — re-runnable, each pass sends a real email

Against the deployed Worker, not localhost:

```bash
curl -s https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.yoursubdomain.workers.dev/graphql \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { sendTestEmail(to: \"you@example.com\") }"}'
```

| Check                                      | Expect                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| the call above                             | `{"data":{"sendTestEmail":true}}`         |
| your inbox                                 | the message arrives                       |
| the same call with an address off the list | an error, and no message                  |
| "show original" in the client              | a `text/plain` part, not just `text/html` |

`true` only proves Resend accepted it; arrival is what proves React Email rendered under
workerd and a Worker's egress reached the API.

**What this repo actually recorded, 2026-09-06 12:59.** Three of those four rows turned out to
live in Resend's dashboard rather than in a person's inbox, so they were driven rather than
handed over:

| Row                        | Evidence                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the call                   | `{"data":{"sendTestEmail":true}}`                                                                                   |
| the message arrives        | resend.com/emails → **Delivered**, with `Sent 12:59` and `Delivered 12:59` as separate events, and `"last_event": "delivered"` in the Raw tab |
| the address off the list   | `Recipient is not in MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS`, and **no second row** in the message list                               |
| a `text/plain` part        | the Raw tab's `"text"` populated beside `"html"`, carrying the URL twice; **Insights** independently reports *Include plain text version* ✓ |

`Delivered` is the receiving MX accepting the message, which is strictly stronger than the
`true` this gate was written to settle for. The deploy reported the same bundle as the dry run —
2576.23 KiB raw, 520.85 KiB gzipped — and `wrangler secret list` shows `RESEND_API_KEY` as
`secret_text`.

**Still the user's:** whether it *looks* right in a real client. A dashboard preview is not an
inbox, and rendering is exactly what inboxes disagree about.

**Two Insights warnings are expected here and are not defects.** `Ensure link URLs match sending
domain` and `Use a subdomain` fire because the link is `https://cc4-test.example/...` and the
sender is the shared `onboarding@resend.dev` — both placeholders this slice chooses on purpose,
and both already named in `Leaves behind`. They clear when a verified domain lands.

**The key was moved without ever being displayed.** Resend renders a new key in an
`<input type="password">` beside a **Copy to clipboard** button, so it went dashboard → clipboard
→ `wrangler secret put` with only a length (36) and a prefix (`re_`) ever printed, and the
clipboard cleared afterwards. The key created for this project is named `cc4-test-worker` and is
scoped **Sending access**, not Full access.

### 6. If it fails

| Symptom                                      | Where it broke                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Recipient is not in MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS`   | step 2, not redeployed since                                            |
| `MAIL_TRANSPORT=resend needs RESEND_API_KEY` | step 3 never ran, or ran against a different Worker                     |
| `Resend refused the message: …`              | Resend — usually `MAIL_FROM` against the recipient from step 1          |
| `true`, but nothing arrives                  | spam folder, then Resend's dashboard, which logs every accepted message |

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler tail        # then re-run step 5 in another shell
```

That separates "the resolver threw" from "Resend accepted and did not deliver".

## The operating manual

````bash
cd ../..
mkdir -p .claude/skills/project-email
cat > .claude/skills/project-email/SKILL.md <<'EOF'
---
name: project-email
description: Write or change transactional email in cc4-test — React Email templates in packages/email, the render helpers, and the Resend transport. Use when a feature sends mail, when a template's copy or markup changes, or when the mail transport or sender address changes.
---

# email — `packages/email`

## Owns / never touches

- **Owns:** `emails/*.tsx` (templates), `src/render.tsx` (subject + html + text),
  `src/mailer.ts` (transports). Exported through `src/index.ts`.
- **Never imports the Worker's `Env`.** `createMailer` takes `MailEnv`, declared
  structurally, so this package does not know it runs on Workers.
- **Never sends from a test.** Unit tests mock the `resend` module and assert the payload.
  The one real send is a gate row a human runs.
- Only `apps/graphql` imports this package. `apps/web` has no reason to.

## Adding a template

```bash
# 1. emails/<name>.tsx — a component, plus a default export and PreviewProps
# 2. src/render.tsx — a render<Name>Email() returning { subject, html, text }
# 3. export it from src/index.ts
pnpm --filter @cc4-test/email email:dev      # preview on :3001, not :3000
```

- **Inline styles only.** Email clients strip or ignore `<style>` and there is no cascade.
  This is the one place in the repo where naming a colour is correct — `theme.css` does not
  reach a mail client.
- **Always render a text alternative** (`render(element, { plainText: true })`). Without one
  the message scores as spam and shows empty in a client with HTML off.
- **Import everything from `react-email`** — components and `render` both. The old
  `@react-email/components` and per-component packages are deprecated as of `react-email@6`;
  an example written before then imports from packages that still install and no longer get
  fixed.
- **The subject belongs in the render function, not the template.** A component renders a
  body; keeping the pair in one function is what stops a template going out under someone
  else's subject.
- **Every actionable link appears as bare text as well as a button.** A client that blocks
  the button otherwise leaves the recipient with no way through.

## Transports

`MAIL_TRANSPORT` selects one, and unset or unknown **throws**:

| Value    | Behaviour                      | Where                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `log`    | renders, prints, sends nothing | `.env.development`, tests |
| `resend` | sends; needs `RESEND_API_KEY`  | `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`   |

Never infer the transport from `NODE_ENV` or from whether a key is present: both fail open,
and a production deploy that lost its key would report every send as a success.

## Judgment calls

- `RESEND_API_KEY` is a **secret** — `wrangler secret put`, never a `vars` entry. It is
  therefore **absent from the generated `WorkerEnv`**, and `createMailer(ctx)` typechecks only
  because `MailEnv` declares it optional. A missing secret is a runtime error by design, not a
  compile-time one; the `if (!key) throw` in `createMailer` is what turns it into a loud one.
- `MAIL_FROM` must be on a domain Resend has verified for the account, or delivery fails at
  Resend rather than in your code. `onboarding@resend.dev` needs no domain but only delivers
  to your own account address.
- The Resend SDK returns `{ data, error }` and does **not** throw. An unchecked call makes a
  failed send indistinguishable from a successful one.
- `sendTestEmail` is a scaffold mutation guarded by `MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS`, which fails
  closed. Do not widen it, and do not model real mail on it — real sends are triggered by a
  domain event, not by a caller naming a recipient.

## Enforced elsewhere

- `src/mailer.test.ts` pins the payload, the error path, that `log` touches no network, and
  that an unset transport throws.
- `src/render.test.ts` pins that the link survives into the text alternative.
- `apps/graphql/src/mail.test.ts` pins the allowlist, including that empty means nobody.

````

`CLAUDE.md` gains the package, and nothing else — it is the one file every session pays for:

```diff
--- CLAUDE.md
+- `packages/email` — React Email templates and the Resend transport. `apps/graphql` is its
+  only consumer. See `.claude/skills/project-email/SKILL.md`.
 - `packages/config` — shared tsconfig and ESLint base, extended by every package.
```

**This hunk was rewritten for this repo.** The reference anchors on a prose sentence naming
`packages/db` and `packages/config` together; this project's `CLAUDE.md` is a bullet list, one
entry per package, each pointing at its own skill file. The bullet above follows that shape
rather than the reference's sentence.

Worth recording while the file is open: **`packages/db` has no bullet at all.** Slice 3 built
it and the operating manual it wrote (`.claude/skills/project-db/SKILL.md`) is not reachable
from here, so a session that has not been told about the database will not find it. That is
slice 3's gap and not this slice's to close on its own judgement — adding it would be an
undescribed edit to a file another slice's plan owns, which `docs:check` would then read as
drift against that slice. Flagged for the user to decide.

## Sources

The documentation this slice's §3 research rests on — kept here rather than in a shared
bibliography, so that reading the slice is reading its evidence. **Re-check rather than
inherit:** a source is only as good as the day it was read, and the version pins in this slice
are claims about a registry that moves. `changelog/` records what changed here and why.

- [Resend Node SDK](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nodejs) and [Resend on Cloudflare Workers](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-cloudflare-workers)
- [React Email components](https://react.email/docs/components/html) and [`render`](https://react.email/docs/utilities/render)
- [React Email CHANGELOG](https://github.com/resend/react-email/blob/main/packages/react-email/CHANGELOG.md) — the v6 consolidation and its migration steps are only stated here
- [React Email CLI](https://react.email/docs/cli) (`email dev`)
- [Workers secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) (`wrangler secret put`)

## Leaves behind

Read by Slice 99 (the audit), which treats this as a **cross-check and never as the source of truth** —
the code is that. An entry here is a claim about the repo; where the two disagree, the code
wins and this table is the finding.

**Provisional** is something built to prove a mechanism, with the condition that retires it.
**Accepted** is a risk taken knowingly, with the reasoning written down so a later slice can
re-decide it rather than rediscover it.

### Provisional

| Artifact                        | Why it exists                                                                    | Retired when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `sendTestEmail` + `src/mail.ts` | The slice needs something observable in production; nothing else sends mail yet. | **No slice retires it, and that is a known gap.** It has no successor: Slice 6 adds real verification mail _alongside_ it rather than replacing it, and Slice 7 documents it as part of the schema. Retire it deliberately, or accept it deliberately — but not by default. |

### Accepted

| Risk                                                      | Reachable by        | Why this is the right trade                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| An unauthenticated mutation sends real mail               | The entire internet | No session layer exists until Slice 6. `MAIL_TEST_RECIPIENTS` fails closed, so the worst a stranger achieves is mail to the one address already listed — not a relay, but still an unauthenticated way to fill the owner's inbox. |
| That mutation is discoverable through production GraphiQL | The entire internet | Inherited from Slice 2's default. This slice is the first to make that default _cost_ something, which is why it is restated here rather than left upstream.                                                                      |
| `MAIL_FROM` is Resend's shared `onboarding@resend.dev`    | —                   | Needs no verified domain, and delivers only to the account owner's own address, which bounds the blast radius while the pipeline is being proven. A real domain is required before real users.                                    |
