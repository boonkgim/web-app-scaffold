# Slice 3 — Database: Docker locally, Neon in production

`packages/db`, and then the seam between it and the Worker the GraphQL slice deployed: Docker → schema →
migrations → wire the Worker → local gate → Neon → Hyperdrive → production gate.

Both halves of what a horizontal slice owes, in that order. **Infrastructure:** migrations
apply and a row round-trips through a real Postgres, proven by this package's own integration
test with nothing downstream involved. **Integration:** the GraphQL slice's `health` resolver stops
answering out of thin air and starts answering out of a table, reached through a Hyperdrive
binding. The observable never changes — the page said `health` before and says `health` after
— which is precisely what makes the second half a proof about a seam rather than a feature.

## Preflight

```bash
docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'              # the daemon running, not just installed
grep -l DATABASE_URL packages/db/.env* 2>/dev/null    # is a connection string already here?
```

Docker blocks **Round 1** — the local gate cannot run without it. The Neon project blocks
**Round 2 only**, so the infrastructure half can be built, gated and committed first.
`USER-SETUP.md` has both, including the create-form toggle that must stay off.

## Local half

Root `docker-compose.yml`. Check where the previous slice left you before copying the `cd`
below — a slice that ended by writing its skill file ended at the repo root, and this file
belongs there:

**Pin the newest Postgres major Neon offers, and do not ask.** Neon's create-project form
already defaults to it (18, as of 2026-08), it supports the five newest majors, and a
greenfield project has no reason to want an older one. The only case that picks a different
number is an existing Neon project already running one — then match _it_, because the local
container exists to make "applies locally" mean "applies there".

```bash
cat > docker-compose.yml <<'EOF'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:18
    ports:
      - "5434:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: web-app-scaffold
    # /var/lib/postgresql, NOT /var/lib/postgresql/data. Postgres 18 changed where the
    # image puts its data: PGDATA moved to a major-versioned subdirectory
    # (/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker) so `pg_upgrade --link` can work across majors
    # without crossing a mount boundary. Mount the pre-18 path on 18 and the container
    # exits 1 on first start with a wall of text about pg_upgrade — NOT an
    # obviously-wrong-volume error, so it reads as a broken image rather than a wrong
    # line. See docker-library/postgres#1259.
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql
    # So `docker compose up -d --wait` can block until Postgres actually accepts
    # connections. Without it `pnpm start` races: the container is "up" some seconds
    # before the socket answers, and the migrate step right after it fails.
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 15
volumes:
  pgdata:
EOF
docker compose up -d --wait
```

**The daily loop from here on:** `docker compose up -d` once, then `pnpm turbo dev` runs both
`apps/web` and, later, the API Worker. Small commits at every green gate keep fast iteration
reversible.

`packages/db` (`@web-app-scaffold/db`):

Unlike the root `pnpm init` in slice 0, this one wrote **no `devEngines` block** — that trap is
a root-init behaviour, so there is nothing to delete here. Verified on the run that built this.

```bash
mkdir -p packages/db && cd packages/db && pnpm init
pnpm pkg set name="@web-app-scaffold/db"
pnpm pkg set exports="./src/index.ts"
pnpm pkg delete main
pnpm add drizzle-orm pg
pnpm add -D drizzle-kit @types/pg
```

The `exports` line is load-bearing and easy to skip: `pnpm init` writes `"main": "index.js"`
pointing at a file this package never creates, so `import ... from "@web-app-scaffold/db"` fails to
resolve in every consumer — wrangler's build error even suggests adding an `alias`, which
treats the symptom. Because the base tsconfig sets `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, `exports`
can name the TypeScript source directly and no build step is needed; wrangler, vitest, and
`tsc` all follow it.

Cloudflare recommends **node-postgres (`pg`)** over `postgres.js` — best compatibility with
Hyperdrive's query caching — and its stated minimum has moved: **≥ 8.16.3** as of 2026-08, up
from 8.13. Re-read the floor rather than trusting this number; the page also moved, to
`.../connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/`.

Re-read on 2026-09-06 at that URL: the floor is still **8.16.3**, unchanged, and `pnpm add pg`
resolves 8.23.0 — comfortably above it, so no pin is needed. The same page requires
`nodejs_compat` and a current `compatibility_date`; `apps/graphql/wrangler.jsonc` already
carries `nodejs_compat` and `2026-09-03`, so nothing there changes.

Cloudflare's own sample now builds a bare `Client` per request rather than a `Pool`. Keep the
`Pool` below: `maxUses: 1` is the same contract (a connection used once, then discarded) while
leaving one type both callers can use — the Worker through Hyperdrive, and this package's
integration test straight against Docker. Drizzle re-exposes either as `$client`, which is what
lets that test close the handle.

`src/schema.ts` — Drizzle tables; single source of truth. Start with one real table so the
gates prove something:

```bash
mkdir -p src
cat > src/schema.ts <<'EOF'
import { pgTable, serial, text } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const items = pgTable("items", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
});
EOF
```

`src/client.ts` — a factory, not a singleton:

```bash
cat > src/client.ts <<'EOF'
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import { Pool } from "pg";
import * as schema from "./schema";

export function createDb(connectionString: string) {
  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString, max: 5, maxUses: 1 });
  return drizzle(pool, { schema });
}
EOF
```

Per-request creation with `maxUses: 1` is the documented Workers pattern — isolates shouldn't
hold connections across requests; Hyperdrive does the real pooling in production, and locally
Docker Postgres doesn't need pooling at all.

`src/index.ts` — the barrel the `exports` field points at. Consumers import the factory and
the tables from the package root, never from its internals:

```bash
cat > src/index.ts <<'EOF'
export { createDb } from "./client";
export * from "./schema";
EOF
```

**The two migration targets.** This package is the only thing in the repo that talks to
Postgres directly rather than through the Hyperdrive binding, so it is the only place a
connection string has to be kept — once per environment. Both files use the **same key**,
`DATABASE_URL`; the _command_ selects the file, never the variable name:

| Target | Env file           | Command                   | Database              |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| local  | `.env.development` | `pnpm migrate`            | Docker                |
| prod   | `.env.production`  | `pnpm migrate:production` | Neon, direct/unpooled |

Neither file is committed — `.gitignore`'s `.env*` covers both. drizzle-kit auto-loads `.env`
but **not** either of these, so load them explicitly (this is the one place in the repo that
needs `dotenv` — Next.js finds `.env.development` by mode, and wrangler is handed it by
`--env-file`):

```bash
pnpm add -D dotenv
cat > drizzle.shared.ts <<'EOF'
import { config } from "dotenv";
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

// Both migration targets are built from here so `out` and `schema` cannot drift
// apart. Two configs that disagreed about `out` would split the migration history
// between environments, which is the one bug in this package with no easy repair.
export function defineDrizzleConfig(envFile: string) {
  // override: true — the file named by the command wins over anything already in the
  // environment. dotenv's default is the opposite, so an exported DATABASE_URL left
  // in a shell would silently retarget the run. For the only command here that can
  // mutate production, the target must come from the command you typed.
  config({ path: envFile, override: true });

  const url = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
  if (!url) {
    throw new Error(
      `packages/db/${envFile} is missing or defines no DATABASE_URL. ` +
        `Both env files are gitignored and use the same key — see docs/setup, Slice 3.`,
    );
  }

  return defineConfig({
    dialect: "postgresql",
    schema: "./src/schema.ts",
    out: "./migrations",
    dbCredentials: { url },
  });
}
EOF
cat > drizzle.config.ts <<'EOF'
import { defineDrizzleConfig } from "./drizzle.shared";

// Local Docker. `pnpm migrate`.
export default defineDrizzleConfig(".env.development");
EOF
cat > drizzle.production.config.ts <<'EOF'
import { defineDrizzleConfig } from "./drizzle.shared";

// Neon, direct/unpooled endpoint. `pnpm migrate:production`.
// Migrations never run from a Worker — always from your machine, against this file.
export default defineDrizzleConfig(".env.production");
EOF
```

`override: true` costs you the inline escape hatch — `DATABASE_URL="…" pnpm migrate` no
longer retargets anything, and that is the point. Migration is the only command in this repo
that mutates production, and a stale export in a shell is exactly how it would hit the wrong
database without anyone typing anything wrong. If you need a third target, add a third config,
not a variable.

`packages/db/.env.development` — gitignored, your machine's values. The name is not
drizzle-kit's to care about, since the config names the file outright; it is
`.env.development` per the convention Slice 0 set, so this package's local file is named the
same as every other package's. `.env.production` is created later, at this slice's production
gate, once the Neon project exists:

```bash
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/web-app-scaffold" > .env.development
```

Add the checklist file too — the only committed env file in the package, holding a dummy
value rather than a real one. One entry covers both targets, since they use the same key:

```bash
cat > .env.example <<'EOF'
# .env.development (Docker) and .env.production (Neon direct/unpooled) both define this
# same key; the command you run picks the file. Neither is committed.
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5434/dbname
EOF
```

The integration test below carries the same Docker URL as an in-code default rather than in a
second env file — see the note under it.

Generate and apply the first migration:

```bash
pnpm generate && pnpm migrate
```

The full standard package setup — all five pieces this time, plus the three migration
scripts. Note the naming rule the rest of the repo follows: **a script that acts on
production ends in `:production`**, and that suffix is the only thing that selects the
production env file. A bare script name never touches production.

```bash
pnpm add -D vitest@^5.0.0   # matches apps/web and apps/graphql; bare `vitest` also lands 5.x today
pnpm pkg set \
  scripts.typecheck="tsc --noEmit" \
  scripts.lint="eslint . --max-warnings 0" \
  scripts.format="prettier --write . --ignore-path ../../.gitignore --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore" \
  scripts.test="vitest run" \
  'scripts["test:unit"]=vitest run --project unit' \
  'scripts["test:integration"]=vitest run --project integration' \
  scripts.generate="drizzle-kit generate" \
  scripts.migrate="drizzle-kit migrate" \
  'scripts["migrate:production"]=drizzle-kit migrate --config drizzle.production.config.ts'
```

`generate` gets no `:production` twin on purpose — it only diffs `src/schema.ts` against the
committed snapshot to write a migration file, and never opens a connection.

```bash
cat > vitest.config.ts <<'EOF'
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    passWithNoTests: true,
    projects: [
      {
        test: {
          name: "unit",
          include: ["src/**/*.test.ts"],
          exclude: ["**/*.int.test.ts"],
        },
      },
      {
        test: {
          name: "integration",
          include: ["src/**/*.int.test.ts"],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
EOF
```

```bash
cat > eslint.config.mjs <<'EOF'
import base from "../../packages/config/eslint.base.mjs";

export default [...base];
EOF
cat > tsconfig.json <<'EOF'
{
  "extends": "../../packages/config/tsconfig.base.json",
  // drizzle-orm ships .d.ts for every dialect it supports — gel, mysql2, and others
  // whose driver packages we deliberately do not install, since we only use pg. Those
  // declarations fail to resolve their own imports, so checking them is checking
  // dependencies we will never load. The API Worker sets the same flag for its own reason.
  "compilerOptions": { "skipLibCheck": true },
  "include": ["src"]
}
EOF
```

And the **first real integration test** — this slice is why `test:integration` exists:

```bash
cat > src/client.int.test.ts <<'EOF'
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { createDb } from "./client";
import { items } from "./schema";

// Docker Compose defaults, identical for everyone — the override is for a nonstandard port.
const DOCKER_URL = "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/web-app-scaffold";
const url = process.env.DATABASE_URL ?? DOCKER_URL;

test("round-trips a row through local Postgres", async () => {
  const db = createDb(url);
  const name = `round-trip-${process.pid}`;

  try {
    const [inserted] = await db.insert(items).values({ name }).returning();
    expect(inserted.name).toBe(name);

    const found = await db
      .select()
      .from(items)
      .where(eq(items.id, inserted.id));
    expect(found).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(found[0].name).toBe(name);

    await db.delete(items).where(eq(items.id, inserted.id));
  } finally {
    // createDb hides the Pool; drizzle re-exposes it as $client. Without this,
    // the open handle keeps vitest from exiting.
    await db.$client.end();
  }
});
EOF
```

Three things this test is doing deliberately. It **asserts on the row it read back**, not just
that the query resolved — a `select` that returns nothing still "succeeds". It **cleans up**,
so re-running doesn't accumulate rows and change the next run's result. And it **closes the
pool** in a `finally`, because `createDb` returns the drizzle instance rather than the `Pool`,
and a leaked handle makes vitest hang after the assertions have already passed.

**Why a default in code instead of a committed `.env.test`:** every env file except
`.env.example` is gitignored, so a test that depended on one would pass for you and fail on a
fresh clone. The value isn't a secret — it's the docker-compose credentials three blocks up,
already in the repo — so the honest place for it is the test. `??` still leaves an escape
hatch, but an exported `DATABASE_URL` is the only one: vitest reads no `.env` file into
`process.env`, so putting a value in `.env.development` will not retarget a test the way it
retargets `pnpm migrate`. That is what CI does — it exports the variable for the tests and
writes the file for drizzle-kit, which is two mechanisms because they really are two.
Docker must be up — that's the contract of `test:integration`.

## Wiring it to the Worker

That is the infrastructure half proven: migrations apply and a row round-trips, without
anything downstream needing to exist. The rest of this slice is the other half a horizontal
slice owes — that the new layer works _integrated_ with what is already built. Slice 2's
Worker currently answers `health` out of thin air; by the end of this section it answers out
of Postgres, and that rewrite is the whole proof.

```bash
cd ../../apps/graphql   # from packages/db
pnpm add @web-app-scaffold/db@workspace:*
```

Add the Hyperdrive binding by rewriting `apps/graphql/wrangler.jsonc`'s binding block by hand
— Slice 2 stopped owning that file whole, and `scripts/docs-check.ignore` already says so.
Locally `wrangler dev` ignores `id` entirely and dials `localConnectionString`, which points at
the Docker Postgres above. `id` is still a **required** key even for purely local development,
which is why a placeholder goes in now rather than the key being left out until production:

```jsonc
  "hyperdrive": [
    {
      "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
      "id": "placeholder-until-production-half",
      "localConnectionString": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/web-app-scaffold",
    },
  ],
```

**Hyperdrive is a binding on a Worker, which is why it is configured here and not in Slice 2.**
It is a connection pooler that fronts _this_ database for _that_ Worker, so it could not exist
before both did. It is this slice's integration step in the most literal sense: the object that
joins the two layers.

**Whether `src/context.ts` needs an edit depends on how the API slice wrote it — read it
before touching it.** Every resolver signature is generated from that type, so `ctx.HYPERDRIVE`
has to exist on it either way, but there are two shapes and only one needs a hand.

**Read on 2026-09-06 in this repo: it is the alias, `export type Env = WorkerEnv`.** So the
first branch applies and `src/context.ts` is not edited in this slice at all — `cf-typegen`
adds `HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive` to the generated `WorkerEnv` and the alias picks it up. The
second branch is kept below only because a hand-written interface is what a future divergence
would look like; it is not a step to run here.

- `export type Env = WorkerEnv` — an alias onto the interface `wrangler types` generates from
  `wrangler.jsonc`. **Edit nothing.** `cf-typegen` adds `HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive` itself, and
  writing it again would create the second description of the bindings the alias exists to
  prevent. This is the shape the current API slice produces, so this is the usual answer.
- A hand-written `export interface Env { … }` listing bindings literally. Then add the line:

  ```diff
  --- apps/graphql/src/context.ts
   export interface Env {
  +  HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
     /** Comma-separated browser origin allowlist — see cors.ts. Optional because it is a
  ```

`Hyperdrive` is part of the generated runtime types rather than something the binding creates,
so it resolves as soon as `cf-typegen` has run once. `wrangler.jsonc` changed, so run both
generators and commit what they write:

```bash
pnpm cf-typegen
pnpm codegen
```

Now the rewrite that is the point of this slice. `health` stops answering for itself:

```bash
cat > src/schema/system/resolvers/Query/health.ts <<'EOF'
import { createDb, items } from "@web-app-scaffold/db";
import type { QueryResolvers } from "./../../../types.generated";

// Reads the migrated table rather than just constructing a client. Building a Pool
// opens no socket, so a health check that skipped this query would pass against a
// database that does not exist. Integration-only by construction.
export const health: NonNullable<QueryResolvers["health"]> = async (
  _parent,
  _arg,
  ctx,
) => {
  const db = createDb(ctx.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString);
  await db.select({ id: items.id }).from(items).limit(1);
  return "ok:db";
};
EOF
```

`version` is deliberately left alone: it touches no database, which is what keeps the unit
suite runnable with neither Docker nor a stub connection string. Splitting the two fields by
what they can honestly reach is what keeps both suites truthful.

And the Worker's own integration test, which Slice 2 had no way to write:

```bash
cat > src/index.int.test.ts <<'EOF'
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import worker, { type Env } from "./index";

const DOCKER_URL = "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/web-app-scaffold";
const env = {
  HYPERDRIVE: { connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL ?? DOCKER_URL },
} as unknown as Env;

test("health round-trips through Postgres", async () => {
  const res = await worker.fetch(
    new Request("http://localhost/graphql", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query: "{ health }" }),
    }),
    env,
  );
  expect(await res.json()).toEqual({ data: { health: "ok:db" } });
});
EOF
```

**Prove the test can fail before trusting it.** node-postgres opens no socket until a query
runs, so a `health` that stopped at `createDb(...)` would return `ok:db` against a database
that does not exist — and this test would pass with Docker down, reporting a round-trip that
never happened. Point it at nothing and watch it go red:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://nobody:nobody@localhost:9999/nope" pnpm test:integration
```

```bash
cd ../..   # back to the repo root
```

**Local gate** — `docker compose up -d` first (from root, where `docker-compose.yml` lives):

| Where          | Check                       | Expect                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| browser        | `localhost:3000`            | `health` now reads `ok:db` — the same page, a different source   |
| `apps/graphql` | `pnpm dev`                  | `{ health }` round-trips through Postgres                        |
| root           | `pnpm typecheck`            | pass                                                             |
| root           | **`pnpm lint`**             | **`5 successful`** — 3 lint (web, graphql, db) + 2 `codegen`     |
| root           | **`pnpm test:unit`**        | **`Tests 17 passed`** — unchanged; nothing here is unit-testable |
| root           | **`pnpm test:integration`** | **`Tests 2 passed`** — db round-trip + health-through-Postgres   |

The browser row is the one that matters, and it is why this slice reads as integration rather
than infrastructure: **the page does not change.** It rendered `health` before and it renders
`health` now — only the source moved, from the Worker's own return statement to a table in
Postgres. A slice that changes where an unchanged observable comes from is exactly a slice
that proves a seam.

**17, not the 19 the reference claimed.** Measured before touching anything:
`pnpm test:unit` reports graphql 10 + web 7. A unit count is a fact about one repo rather than
about the procedure, which is why the reference should never have carried a number this slice
does not itself create — the row that matters is the one below, which this slice does create.

**Round 1 result, 2026-09-06: every row green on the first run, no block needed a fix.**
`typecheck` 5 successful, `lint` 5 successful, `test:unit` 17 (graphql 10 + web 7),
`test:integration` 2 (db 1 + graphql 1), and the page at `localhost:3000` rendering
`api health  ok:db`. The falsifiability check below was run and did fail as intended.

Two notes from that run. `pnpm peers check` reports unmet peers for `graphql-config` and the
`eslint-config-next` plugins — **pre-existing from slices 1 and 2, not introduced here**; drizzle
and pg added none. And `pnpm docs:check` initially flagged `client.int.test.ts` because the
`.select().from().where()` chain had been collapsed to one line: at four spaces of indent that is
80 characters, one over the print width, so prettier breaks it and this doc's multiline form was
right. `prettier --write` settled it in the repo's favour of the doc.

`test:integration` going from 0 to 2 is the signal this slice is real. If it still reports 0,
Docker is down or the `*.int.test.ts` names are wrong — and `passWithNoTests` will report that
as success.

## Production half

Create the Neon project (if not yet) and copy the **direct/unpooled** connection string —
`USER-SETUP.md` §2–3, including the "Enable Neon Auth" toggle that must stay off and how to
tell the pooled host from the direct one.

Write it to `packages/db/.env.production` — gitignored, same `DATABASE_URL` key as
`.env.development`, and the only copy you keep. This is the one string in the whole repo you would
otherwise have to remember and re-paste on every migration:

```bash
cd packages/db
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://...neon direct url..." > .env.production
```

Then apply migrations to Neon from your machine (migrations never run from Workers):

```bash
pnpm migrate:production
```

Expect a `SECURITY WARNING` from `pg` about `sslmode=require` becoming a libpq-semantics alias
in pg v9 / pg-connection-string v3. It is a deprecation notice and the migration applies; do
not go changing the connection string over it.

Two files, one key, and the target named in the command. If you would rather not keep a
production credential on disk, the alternative is a password-manager CLI in the script
(`dotenv -e <(op read …)` or equivalent) — but do not go back to pasting it inline, which is
how it ends up in your shell history and, via a stale export, in the wrong migration.

Then the Hyperdrive config that fronts Neon for the Worker. Run it from `apps/graphql`, where
wrangler is installed (`pnpm wrangler` cannot resolve it from `packages/db`), then copy the
`id` it prints into the placeholder left in `wrangler.jsonc` above:

```bash
cd ../../apps/graphql   # from packages/db
pnpm wrangler hyperdrive create web-app-scaffold-hyperdrive --env-file .env.production --connection-string="postgres://...neon direct url..."
pnpm cf-typegen
```

**`--env-file .env.production` is required whenever the `wrangler login` carries more than one
account** — the same condition the web slice already flags for `deploy`, and it applies to every
command that _creates_ a Cloudflare resource, not just to uploads. Without it wrangler refuses
to guess and the create fails. `.env.production` is where `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` already lives,
and it must be the account the Worker deploys into: a Hyperdrive config in another account
cannot be bound to it.

Two things `create` will offer that you should decline. `--update-config` writes the binding
into `wrangler.jsonc` for you, and reformats the file — dropping every comment explaining it;
and even without that flag the command ends by asking whether to edit the config anyway. A
non-interactive shell answers that one itself (`Using fallback value in non-interactive
context: no`); an interactive one needs you to say no. Copy the `id` over the placeholder by
hand.

Neon's string can go to Hyperdrive with its `?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require` query
intact — no need to strip the parameters.

**Getting the string out of the Neon console without pasting it anywhere.** Turn
**Connection pooling off** in the Connect dialog — the pooled host contains `-pooler` and the
direct one does not, which is the quickest confirmation you have the right one. **Copy snippet**
puts the real string on the clipboard (not the masked form shown on screen), so on Linux
`xclip -selection clipboard -o` moves it console → file without going through a shell history.

Use Neon's **direct (unpooled)** string — the same one just written to
`packages/db/.env.production`. Hyperdrive is itself the pooler; stacking it on Neon's pooled
endpoint is discouraged. `nodejs_compat` with a compatibility date ≥ 2024-09-23 is required for
the `pg` driver, already satisfied by Slice 2's config, and Hyperdrive's caching does not take
effect locally — expected, not a misconfiguration.

Redeploy the Worker so production picks up the binding. API before web is the standing rule,
but only the API changed here:

```bash
pnpm deploy:production
```

`apps/web` really does not need a redeploy — the service binding resolves to the _Worker_, not
to a version of it, so the deployed page serves the new value on its next request. Verify that
rather than redeploying web out of caution.

**Round 2 result, 2026-09-06: green.** The Neon project is `web-app-scaffold` (`<your-neon-project-id>`),
Postgres 18, AWS US East 2 (Ohio), Free tier, branch `production`, created with **Enable Neon
Auth off**. The Hyperdrive config is `web-app-scaffold-hyperdrive`, id
`<your-hyperdrive-id>`, now in `wrangler.jsonc` in place of the placeholder. The API
deployed as version `f41c627d-8a8e-4aff-911d-a39a33472944`, and
`https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.yoursubdomain.workers.dev/graphql` answers
`{"health":"ok:db","appEnv":"production"}`.

`apps/web` was **not** redeployed, and the deployed page still picked up the new value on its
next request — so the claim above about service bindings resolving to the Worker rather than a
version is verified here, not assumed.

One correction to the instructions above, learned by driving them: Neon's pooling switch reports
the same accessible state whether it is on or off, so the toggle cannot be read back. Pooling
also defaults **on**. The check that actually works is on the written file —
`grep -q -- '-pooler' .env.production` — which is what confirmed this repo has the direct
endpoint. Getting this wrong is silent: a pooled string connects and passes every gate here.

**Production gate:** `pnpm migrate:production` applies cleanly to Neon and re-running it is a
no-op — drizzle-kit's journal is the proof it landed and is not re-applied — and the production
page from Slice 2 now shows `health` as `ok:db`, served through Hyperdrive from Neon. Same
page, same field, real data behind it. Commit.

## The operating manual for this layer

Written **before** the production half on this run, not after as the order below implies. Nothing
in it depends on Neon or Hyperdrive, and `docs:check` reports it missing until it exists — so
writing it here is what lets the local half stand as a complete, committable unit with Round 2
still outstanding.

The slice that builds a layer is where that layer's rules are discovered, so it is where they
get written down. `.claude/skills/project-db/SKILL.md`, following the naming rule every slice
that installs a manual obeys: **`project-<layer>`, matching the `name:` in its frontmatter.**
The prefix is not decoration — `db`, `web`, `auth` and `payments` are generic enough to collide
with a skill in `~/.claude/skills/` or a plugin, and a collision does not announce itself: the
wrong manual simply loads. It is what an agent — or a person — reads before
touching the schema from here on: the generate/migrate rhythm, and the judgment calls no tool
can catch, starting with the one that costs data.

It is deliberately thin on general database advice. A skill exists to carry what a model does
_not_ already know: the local port, which command touches production, and the fact that a
rename generates as `DROP` + `ADD`. Anything an agent would get right unprompted is noise.

# db layer — `packages/db`

## Owns / never touches

- **Owns:** `src/schema.ts` is the source of truth for every table. Nothing else defines
  one. Also owns `migrations/` and the client factory in `src/client.ts`.
- **Never:** `apps/web` must not import `@web-app-scaffold/db` — only the API Worker does. The
  dependency graph is the architecture; web reaches data through the API or not at all.
- **Never:** migrations do not run from a Worker. They run from your machine via
  drizzle-kit, against a direct connection — never through Hyperdrive.

## Drizzle mechanics

```bash
docker compose up -d                        # local Postgres — port 5434, not 5432
pnpm --filter @web-app-scaffold/db generate        # writes migrations/NNNN_name.sql + snapshot
#   ↳ READ THE GENERATED SQL NOW
pnpm --filter @web-app-scaffold/db migrate         # applies to local Docker via .env.development
```

`migrate:production` is a separate deliberate command run at deploy time, not here — the
`:production` suffix selects `.env.production` (the Neon **direct/unpooled** URL, under the
same `DATABASE_URL` key) and is what makes a destructive command impossible to type by
accident.

## Judgment calls

- **Read the generated SQL before migrating.** This is the step that gets skipped, and it
  is the only place a data-loss migration is visible before it runs.
- **A column rename generates as `DROP` + `ADD`** — the data goes with it. Prefer additive
  changes. If you genuinely need a rename that preserves data, hand-edit the generated SQL
  to `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN` _before_ running `migrate`.
- **Never edit a migration that has already been applied anywhere** — local or production.
  Write a new one. The applied set is tracked in the database, so an edited file silently
  diverges from what's actually deployed.
- `migrations/meta/` is drizzle's own state (snapshots + `_journal.json`). Never hand-edit
  it; it is what `generate` diffs against to decide what changed.
- Adding an env key means updating `.env.example` in the same change — it is the only
  committed env file and holds dummy values.

## Enforced elsewhere

- Integration tests hit a real database: `*.int.test.ts` (`src/client.int.test.ts`), run by
  `pnpm test:integration`. They need `docker compose up -d` first and are not cached.
- A health check must query an actual table rather than just construct a client: node-postgres
  opens no socket until a query runs, so a check that stopped at `createDb(...)` would report
  healthy against a database that does not exist.

## The package map

`CLAUDE.md` gains the package and a pointer to the skill this slice just wrote, matching what
Slices 2 and 4 did for the two apps. Without it the operating manual above is unreachable: a
session that has not been told the database layer exists has no path from `CLAUDE.md` to
`.claude/skills/project-db/SKILL.md`, and the rule most worth reaching — `apps/web` never
imports this package — is stated only there.

```diff
--- CLAUDE.md
+- `packages/db` — Drizzle schema, migrations and the client factory. Postgres in Docker
+  locally, Neon through Hyperdrive in production. `apps/graphql` is its only consumer;
+  `apps/web` never imports it. See `.claude/skills/project-db/SKILL.md`.
 - `packages/config` — shared tsconfig and ESLint base, extended by every package.
```

**Added on 2026-09-06, while building Slice 5, not when this slice ran.** The omission surfaced
because Slice 5's own `CLAUDE.md` hunk had to anchor next to the `packages/config` line and the
`packages/db` entry that should have preceded it was not there. Recording it here rather than
in Slice 5 is what keeps `docs:check` honest: the hunk belongs to the slice that built the
package, and filing it under Slice 5 would have left this plan describing a repo it no longer
matched.

## Sources

The documentation this slice's §3 research rests on — kept here rather than in a shared
bibliography, so that reading the slice is reading its evidence. **Re-check rather than
inherit:** a source is only as good as the day it was read, and the version pins in this slice
are claims about a registry that moves. `changelog/` records what changed here and why.

## Leaves behind

Read by Slice 99 (the audit), which treats this as a **cross-check and never as the source of truth** —
the code is that. An entry here is a claim about the repo; where the two disagree, the code
wins and this table is the finding.

**Provisional** is something built to prove a mechanism, with the condition that retires it.
**Accepted** is a risk taken knowingly, with the reasoning written down so a later slice can
re-decide it rather than rediscover it.
