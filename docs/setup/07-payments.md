# Slice 7 — Payments: embedded Checkout and a verified webhook

Horizontal, because three pipelines have never run: an **inbound** request from a third party
— the first traffic this stack takes that came from neither a browser nor `apps/web`; a
signature verified over a raw body under workerd's WebCrypto; and a payment form that runs
**inside our own page**, served by a host we do not own, initialised by a key that
`next build` bakes into the browser bundle.

Slice 5 proved a Worker can call out to an API. This is the other direction, and the
direction where being wrong costs money.

## Which Stripe account to build against

Use a **sandbox account whose CLI config holds no live key at all**, not a live-capable
account switched into test mode. The difference is worth the setup: test mode becomes a
property of the account rather than a variable some later command has to get right, which
is a stronger guarantee than `STRIPE_MODE` alone. A mistyped flag against a live-capable
profile can move real money; against a sandbox there is no live key to reach for.

If that sandbox is not your CLI's default profile — and it should not have to be — give
every `stripe` command in this slice `--project-name '<your sandbox profile>'`, so the
account is named at each call site instead of inherited from ambient state.

Both credentials the slice needs are already on this machine: `stripe login` stored a
`test_mode_api_key` (an `rk_test_` restricted key — which `assertKeyMatchesMode` accepts by
design) and a `test_mode_pub_key` per profile. They are moved into the gitignored env files
through a pipe behind a guard that exits non-zero on anything without `_test_`, never pasted
and never printed, so `USER-SETUP.md` §2 does not apply here.

**They expire on 2026-09-26.** CLI-issued keys are time-limited in a way dashboard keys are
not, so a deploy after that date fails on an expired key rather than on anything this slice
built. Re-running `stripe login` reissues them; a project meant to outlive the month should
take dashboard keys instead.

## Preflight

```bash
stripe --version                             # CLI installed?
stripe config --list | grep -q account_id    # an account linked? exit code only
```

**Never let `stripe config --list` print** — it writes `pk_live_…` and account ids straight to
the terminal. Read the exit code.

The CLI blocks **Round 1**, which forwards webhooks through `stripe listen`. The account blocks
both rounds. `USER-SETUP.md` has each, and stays in test mode throughout.

## Shape

```
browser ──▶ /checkout ──server action──▶ web-app-scaffold-web ──binding──▶ web-app-scaffold-graphql ──▶ Stripe API
        ◀──────────────── client secret ◀──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
browser ──▶ js.stripe.com ──▶ Stripe's form, in an iframe, on our origin
        the page never leaves; the visitor's card details never touch this stack

Stripe ──POST /stripe/webhook──▶ web-app-scaffold-graphql ──▶ Hyperdrive ──▶ Postgres
        signed; no cookie, no Origin, no proxy
```

The webhook lands on the API Worker's own public URL. Slice 6's proxy exists so a session
cookie can belong to the origin the browser asked — a webhook has no cookie and no origin, so
the proxy buys nothing and costs one more hop that can re-encode the bytes the signature
covers. What authenticates Stripe here is the signature, not where the request arrived.

Embedded rather than hosted Checkout moves one risk and adds two. Gone: returning the visitor
to the right host, because they never left it. New: a publishable key that is inlined at build
time rather than read at runtime, which is the opposite of every other credential in this
repo; and a payment surface that is an iframe, so it does not inherit the app's theme and
fails blank rather than loudly.

## Decisions

| Decision                                                            | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Webhook direct to `web-app-scaffold-graphql`, not through the proxy | No cookie to keep same-origin. The signature is the authentication, and every extra hop is a chance to alter the bytes it covers.                                                                                                                      |
| `stripe` with `httpClient: Stripe.createFetchHttpClient()`          | The SDK's default client reaches for `node:https`, which workerd does not provide however `nodejs_compat` is set. It fails at the first call, not at import.                                                                                           |
| `constructEventAsync` + `createSubtleCryptoProvider()`              | WebCrypto is async, so the synchronous `constructEvent` cannot run here at all.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Raw body read once, as text, before anything parses it              | The signature covers the exact bytes sent. `request.json()` consumes the body, and re-serialising the object yields different bytes for the same data.                                                                                                 |
| `stripe_event`, keyed on Stripe's event id                          | Stripe retries, and retries repeat the id. A primary-key conflict is idempotency with no read to race against; a "have I seen this?" check has one.                                                                                                    |
| The webhook is the record, the return page is not                   | A visitor can pay and close the tab. Stripe says to treat the return as a convenience, which is why this slice is a webhook.                                                                                                                           |
| `ui_mode: "embedded_page"`, and so `return_url` and no `cancel_url` | The API rejects `cancel_url` on an embedded session outright — there is no "cancel" to redirect, because the form was never a page of its own.                                                                                                         |
| `redirect_on_completion` left at its default `always`               | The alternative, `"never"` plus an `onComplete` callback, makes a browser callback the only completion signal. That is weaker evidence than a redirect, and this slice already says the redirect is not evidence.                                      |
| A dedicated `/checkout` route, not the embed on the home card       | The embed is a tall iframe with its own minimum width; the home card is a 28rem status panel. Mounting it there would fight both.                                                                                                                      |
| `fetchClientSecret`, not a server-rendered `clientSecret`           | A secret rendered into the page is a session created for every visitor who merely loads the route, and it cannot be replaced without a new page. The callback also gives the return page's `open` branch somewhere to go back to for a _fresh_ secret. |
| `STRIPE_MODE` named, checked against the secret key's prefix        | Fail-closed like `MAIL_TRANSPORT`. A mode inferred from the key can never disagree with the key, so it catches nothing — including a live key in a dev deploy.                                                                                         |
| Web checks the **shape** of its publishable key, not its mode       | A publishable key cannot move money: `pk_live_` in a test build is a form that fails to load — loud and free. The silent mistake is pasting `sk_` into a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` var, and that is what the check catches.                                       |
| Inline `price_data`, no dashboard Price                             | A product created by hand is a one-time step no doc can check, and the amount belongs in the repo as integer cents.                                                                                                                                    |
| `WEB_ORIGIN` replaces `BETTER_AUTH_URL`                             | The return URL needs the same fact Better Auth's `baseURL` needs. One fact under two names drifts the first time one of them moves.                                                                                                                    |

That last row is a rename inside a payments slice, so it is worth saying why it is not scope
creep: the alternative is a second var holding the identical string, and the failure it
produces — a mailed link on one host and a Checkout return on another — appears only after a
domain move, in production, months later. The change is one line of code and four env
entries, and `src/auth.int.test.ts` covers it.

## packages/db

One table. It is the whole observable output of the slice: nothing else writes it, so a row
means a signed delivery arrived and was accepted.

```bash
cd packages/db
```

```diff
--- packages/db/src/schema.ts
-import { pgTable, serial, text } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
+import { pgTable, serial, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

 export const items = pgTable("items", {
   id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
   name: text("name").notNull(),

+// delivery then conflicts instead of inserting twice, and that conflict is the entire
+// idempotency mechanism. Nothing reads before writing, so there is no window for two
+// concurrent deliveries of the same event to both decide they are the first.
+//
+// No payload column. The event body is Stripe's to hold and is retrievable from their
+// API by id; copying it here would put card metadata in our database for nothing.
+export const stripeEvent = pgTable("stripe_event", {
+  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
+  type: text("type").notNull(),
+  receivedAt: timestamp("received_at", { withTimezone: true })
+    .notNull()
+    .defaultNow(),
+});
```

`withTimezone` because the only two things that will ever compare these values are a Worker
in an unknown region and a psql session on your laptop. A bare `timestamp` stores no offset
and both of them guess.

**Then re-export the query operators**, because two files below need `desc` and `eq` and
`apps/graphql` cannot import them. `drizzle-orm` is a dependency of `packages/db` alone, so
`import { desc } from "drizzle-orm"` in a resolver does not resolve under pnpm's strict
layout — it fails at `pnpm typecheck` with `Cannot find module`. The fix is not to add a
second direct dependency: this package owns the drizzle version, and a second pin in another
package is a second version to drift.

```diff
--- packages/db/src/index.ts
 export { createDb } from "./client";
 export * from "./schema";
+
+// The query operators resolvers need, re-exported rather than imported from
+// "drizzle-orm" at the call site. apps/graphql does not depend on drizzle-orm and
+// should not start: this package owns the drizzle version, and a second direct pin in
+// another package is a second version to drift. Every other db symbol a resolver uses
+// (createDb, items, stripeEvent) already arrives this way, so this keeps one import
+// line per resolver instead of two from two different owners.
+//
+// Named explicitly, not `export * from "drizzle-orm"` — that would re-export hundreds
+// of symbols and collide with the table names above.
+export { and, asc, desc, eq, inArray, isNull, not, or, sql } from "drizzle-orm";
```

```bash
pnpm generate
#   ↳ READ THE GENERATED SQL — one CREATE TABLE, no ALTER on an existing one
pnpm migrate
```

## apps/graphql

```bash
cd ../../apps/graphql
pnpm add stripe
```

No catalog entry: `stripe` has exactly one installer, and the catalog is for versions two
packages must agree on. `@stripe/stripe-js` in `apps/web` is a different package that speaks
a different half of the protocol, not a second copy of this one.

The SDK pins the Stripe API version it was built against and sends it on every call, so
`apiVersion` is deliberately left unset — upgrading the package is what moves the API
version, as a lockfile change you can read, rather than on Stripe's release schedule.

Resolved **22.6.1** on 2026-09-06, and `npm view stripe deprecated` is empty. The reference
verified the `workerd` export condition by reading the 22.6.0 tarball; 22.6.1 is a patch on
that same minor, so the reasoning below about `httpClient` carries over unchanged rather than
being re-derived.

### The webhook handler

Unchanged by the move to embedded Checkout, and that is the point: the browser-side flow is a
convenience, and the thing that records money is deliberately independent of it.

// provider reads no binding and performs no I/O.

 *  claim /stripe/webhooks-disabled. */

}

### Routing

The Worker now serves three things. Both non-Yoga branches sit ahead of it for the same
reason — they are HTTP endpoints, not GraphQL — and the webhook sits ahead of CORS for a
different one: `corsFor` names browser origins, and Stripe sends no `Origin` at all.

     return yoga.fetch(request, env, ...(ctx ? [ctx] : []));
```

### Env

`BETTER_AUTH_URL` becomes `WEB_ORIGIN`, because the Checkout return URL needs the same value:

```diff
--- apps/graphql/src/auth.ts
 export function createAuth(env: Env) {
-  const webOrigin = requireEnv(env, "BETTER_AUTH_URL");
+  // WEB_ORIGIN, not BETTER_AUTH_URL: Slice 7 needs this same origin for Stripe's
+  // return URL, and one fact under two names disagrees with itself the first time
+  // either moves. The name says what the value is, not which library first wanted it.
+  const webOrigin = requireEnv(env, "WEB_ORIGIN");
```

```diff
--- apps/graphql/src/auth.int.test.ts
   HYPERDRIVE: { connectionString: CONNECTION },
-  BETTER_AUTH_URL: WEB,
+  WEB_ORIGIN: WEB,
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: "integration-test-secret-not-used-anywhere-else",
```

```diff
--- apps/graphql/.env.example
-# The origin the browser sees - apps/web, never this Worker. See src/auth.ts.
-BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
-# The two keys with no counterpart in wrangler.jsonc. Secrets are set with
+# The origin the browser sees - apps/web, never this Worker. Better Auth's baseURL and
+# Stripe Checkout's return host are the same fact, so they are one key.
+WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
+# test or live, checked against the key prefix below. Unset is an error, never a guess.
+STRIPE_MODE=test
+# The four keys with no counterpart in wrangler.jsonc. Secrets are set with
 # `wrangler secret put` and stored by Cloudflare; a `vars` entry would be plaintext.
 RESEND_API_KEY=re_dev_only_not_a_real_key
+# The generator prints a whole `KEY=value` line - paste only the part after the `=`.
 BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=dev-only-not-a-real-secret
+STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_dev_only_not_a_real_key
+# Printed by `stripe listen`, and not the deployed endpoint's. Stable per account and
+# device rather than per run - `stripe listen --print-secret` returns the same value, so
+# restarting the CLI is not a reason to re-copy it.
+STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_dev_only_not_a_real_secret
```

`wrangler.jsonc` by hand, as always — it carries an account-specific Hyperdrive id:

```jsonc
{
  ...,
  "vars": {
    ...,
    // Renamed from BETTER_AUTH_URL. Same value, same reason it must be the web origin;
    // now also the host Stripe returns the visitor to after Checkout.
    "WEB_ORIGIN": "https://web-app-scaffold-web.yoursubdomain.workers.dev",
    // test or live. Deployed value, and the one var in this file worth reading twice:
    // src/stripe.ts refuses to start if the deployed key disagrees with it.
    "STRIPE_MODE": "test"
  }
}
```

Local overrides go in `.env.development` by hand — gitignored, and it now holds three
credentials:

```ini
WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
STRIPE_MODE=test
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
# Printed by `stripe listen` when it starts. New value each session.
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

Delete the old `BETTER_AUTH_URL` line while you are in there; leaving it is harmless and
misleading, which is the pair of properties that keeps a stale key alive for years.

```bash
pnpm cf-typegen
```

### The schema module

A new module directory, not a line in someone else's:

```bash
mkdir -p src/schema/payments
cat > src/schema/payments/schema.graphql <<'EOF'
type Mutation {
  """
  Creates an embedded Stripe Checkout Session for one fixed test item and returns its
  client secret, which mounts the form in the browser. Exists to prove the payment
  pipeline in production; not part of any feature.
  """
  createTestCheckoutSession: String!
}

type Query {
  """
  The status of a Checkout Session, read back from Stripe by id. The id comes off the
  return URL, so it is a claim until this field checks it — never a fact the browser
  is allowed to assert.
  """
  checkoutSessionStatus(id: ID!): CheckoutStatus!

  """
  Stripe events this API has accepted, newest first. The webhook is the only writer, so
  an empty list means nothing has been delivered — not that nothing has been paid.
  """
  stripeEvents(limit: Int! = 5): [StripeEvent!]!
}

"""
Stripe's three terminal session states, narrowed to an enum so the web layer gets an
exhaustive union rather than a string it has to guess the domain of.
"""

  COMPLETE
  EXPIRED
}

type StripeEvent {
  id: ID!
  type: String!
  """
  ISO 8601, in UTC. A String rather than a scalar, because this schema has no custom
  scalars and one added for a single field is a contract to maintain for a timestamp.
  """
  receivedAt: String!
}
EOF
```

`CheckoutStatus` is this schema's first enum, and the default emission is a real TypeScript
`enum` — a runtime object that every comparison has to import, including from a JSX
expression in another app. One line makes it a union of string literals instead: identical
exhaustiveness, nothing to import, nothing added to either bundle, and a resolver that can
return `"COMPLETE"`.

### The integration test

The unit tests above cover every path that is refused. What only a real Worker and a real
database can show is the accepted one — and that the second copy of an event changes nothing.

```bash
cat > src/stripe-webhook.int.test.ts <<'EOF'

import { expect, test } from "vitest";

  STRIPE_MODE: "test",
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: "sk_test_never_calls_stripe_in_this_file",
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: SECRET,

// Nothing here reaches the network. Verifying a signature is HMAC over the body and the
// secret, computed locally; the client exists only to hold that code.
const stripe = new Stripe("sk_test_never_calls_stripe_in_this_file");

const sign = (payload: string) =>
  stripe.webhooks.generateTestHeaderString({ payload, secret: SECRET });

const deliver = (body: string, signature: string) =>

```

## apps/web

Nothing here imports `stripe`, and nothing should: the secret key is a secret and this app has
no Hyperdrive binding to record anything with. What it does now import is the _other_ pair of
packages — the browser half, which holds no key it did not get from a public var.

```bash
cd ../web
pnpm add @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

Resolved on 2026-09-06 as `@stripe/stripe-js` **9.15.0** and `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
**6.9.0**, neither deprecated. The pair has to be checked together rather than separately:
react-stripe-js 6.x peers `@stripe/stripe-js >=9.10.0 <10.0.0` and `react >=16.8.0 <20.0.0`,
so 9.15.0 and this repo's catalog React 19.2.8 both sit inside it. A `@stripe/stripe-js`
that had moved to 10 would install cleanly and then fail its peer.

`@stripe/stripe-js` is a loader, not a copy of Stripe.js: it injects the script from
`js.stripe.com` at runtime. That is not an optimisation to undo — self-hosting or bundling
that script takes you out of the PCI posture the iframe exists to provide, and Stripe say so
outright.

### The publishable key

```bash
cat > src/lib/stripe.ts <<'EOF'
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";

/** Assert the public key is a public key.
 *
 *  Not a mode check, unlike the API's. A publishable key cannot move money, so a
 *  pk_live_ shipped in a test build is a form that refuses to load — loud, immediate,
 *  and free. The mistake worth catching here is the opposite one and it is silent:
 *  pasting an sk_ key into a NEXT_PUBLIC_ var hands a key that can charge cards to
 *  everyone who views source, and nothing else in the stack would notice.
 *
 *  The message never echoes the value, for the case where the value is the secret.
 */
export function assertPublishableKey(key: string | undefined): string {
  if (!key) {
    throw new Error("Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY");
  }
  if (!key.startsWith("pk_")) {
    throw new Error(
      "NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY must begin pk_ — never a secret key",
    );
  }
  return key;
}

/** Module scope and exactly once, which is Stripe's own instruction: loadStripe injects
 *  a script tag, and calling it inside a render would re-run that on every render.
 *
 *  The literal member expression is the only form `next build` inlines — see the web
 *  skill. It also means this value is fixed at build time rather than read from the
 *  Worker's env, so changing keys is a rebuild, not a `wrangler secret put`.
 */
export const stripePromise = loadStripe(
  assertPublishableKey(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY),
);
EOF
cat > src/lib/stripe.test.ts <<'EOF'
import { expect, test } from "vitest";

```

Module scope is the catch that only shows up when the test runs: importing this file to test
`assertPublishableKey` also evaluates `stripePromise`, which calls that same guard. Vitest
reads no env file and does no `next build` inlining, so the key is `undefined` and the
module throws before a single test is collected. The unit project supplies one:

```diff
--- apps/web/vitest.config.ts
           name: "unit",
           include: ["src/**/*.test.ts"],
           exclude: ["**/*.int.test.ts"],
+          // src/lib/stripe.ts calls loadStripe at module scope behind the same guard
+          // it exports, so importing it to test that guard runs it. Vitest reads no
+          // env file, and next build's inlining is not in play here -- without a
+          // value the module throws before a single test is collected.
+          //
+          // A literal pk_test_ key and not the real one: nothing here reaches Stripe,
+          // and a test that needs a credential is a test a fresh clone cannot run.
+          env: {
+            NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY:
+              "pk_test_unit_tests_never_call_stripe",
+          },
         },
```

A dummy key and not the real one, for the reason the integration test keeps its connection
string in code: a test that needs a credential is a test a fresh clone cannot run.

The key must reach `next build`, not the Worker, so it goes in web's env files:

**Append to `.env.example`, do not `cat >` over it.** The heredoc below is written as a
replacement, and by Slice 7 that file already carries `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` from Slice 1 —
which `deploy:production` reads through wrangler's `--env-file`. Recreating the file deletes
it, nothing fails at the local gate, and the next production deploy is the first thing to
notice. Merge the new key into whatever is there, and check what the file already says about
the mode split before restating it: a project built through Slice 6 may already have
`.env.development` / `.env.production` and no `.env.local`, in which case only the publishable
key below is new.

```diff
--- apps/web/.env.example
 # Which Cloudflare account the Worker is uploaded to. `wrangler whoami` lists
 # yours. Deliberately not in .env.development: the deploy target is not a value
 # your machine gets to supply, and the two may be different accounts.
 CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
+
+# Public by design - the half of the key pair meant to be read by anyone. Belongs in
+# BOTH .env.development and .env.production, because `next dev` reads the first and
+# `next build` - so `pnpm preview` and `pnpm deploy:production` alike - reads the
+# second. Inlined by `next build`, which makes it a build input and not a runtime one:
+# changing it needs a rebuild and redeploy, unlike every secret in apps/graphql. Keep
+# it a pk_test_ key here; see the payments skill.
+NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_dev_only_not_a_real_key
```

A `diff` hunk and not a `cat >` or `cat >>`, for two reasons that both cost a run to learn.
A whole-file rewrite deletes `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, which Slice 1 put there and
`deploy:production` still reads — and nothing fails until the next deploy. A `cat >>` append
fixes that but is invisible to `docs:check`, which parses only whole-file heredocs and diff
hunks, so the file would drift silently from here on. The hunk is the only form that both
preserves what is there and stays checkable.

**This project did the split already, so only the key below is new.** The reference writes
this section for a repo where `apps/web` still has one `.env.local`; here Slice 1 wrote
`.env.development` and `.env.production` and there is no `.env.local` to delete — checked with
`ls -a apps/web/.env*` before touching anything. The load order is kept because it is why the
two files exist and it is the thing a later edit would undo by accident:

```
process.env  >  .env.<mode>.local  >  .env.local  >  .env.<mode>  >  .env
```

`.env.local` is read in **every** mode except `test`, and it sits **above** `.env.<mode>`.
So a key in `.env.local` beats the same key in `.env.production` during a production build —
`.env.production` is silently ignored, and the symptom is a wrong bundle rather than an
error. Verified against `@next/env`'s own loader, not recalled:

```js
const mode = isTest ? "test" : dev ? "development" : "production";
const files = [
  `.env.${mode}.local`,
  mode !== "test" && `.env.local`,
  `.env.${mode}`,
  ".env",
];
```

One file per mode has no such rank to lose. Both files exist already; append the key to each
by hand — they are gitignored and hold an account-specific value:

```ini
# apps/web/.env.development — next dev only. NEXTJS_ENV and NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV are
# already here from Slice 1; only the last line is added.
NEXTJS_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=local
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
```

```ini
# apps/web/.env.production — pnpm preview AND pnpm deploy:production.
# CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID is already here from Slice 1; only the last line is added.
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
```

**No `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` in `.env.production`, unlike the reference's block.** This repo
deliberately keeps it out — `.env.example` says so in as many words — because `preview` and
`deploy:production` each set it on the command line, and `process.env` outranks every file.
Adding it here would be a value that is always overridden, which is a line that looks
load-bearing and is not.

What this does **not** buy is a preview/deploy split: both run `next build`, so both are
`production` and read the same file. Nothing named `.env.*` can separate them — only
`process.env`, which is what `deploy:production` already uses for `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`.
That is why the key here stays `pk_test_`: the live key belongs to whatever runs the deploy,
and a live key in a working copy is a live payment form on `localhost`. Going live is
therefore a CI concern, and CI is a slice this scaffold has not built.

There is no `apps/web/.env.local` in this repo to delete. If one ever appears, delete it:
it outranks both files above and would quietly reinstate the problem they exist to remove.

### The server action

 *  the API service binding is, and Stripe's `fetchClientSecret` option wants exactly a
 *  `() => Promise<string>` — which is what a server action imported into a client
 *  component already is. No route, no JSON envelope, no second place to keep in sync.
 *
 *  It throws rather than returning a sentinel because a rejected promise is the only
 *  failure shape Stripe.js understands here; the caller turns that into something on
 *  screen.
 */
export async function fetchCheckoutClientSecret(): Promise<string> {
  const res = await graphqlFetch(CreateTestCheckoutSession);
  const clientSecret = res.data?.createTestCheckoutSession;

### The event timestamp

The panel says _which_ event landed; the row it was written in also knows _when_. That is a
formatter, and formatters here are tested functions rather than string surgery in a page —
`formatPrice` set the precedent.

```bash
cat > src/lib/formatUtc.ts <<'EOF'
/** Render an ISO 8601 instant as a UTC wall clock, with the zone said out loud.
 *
 *  UTC and not the visitor's zone, for the reason the UI rules give: this renders in a
 *  server component, and the visitor's offset is a value that only exists after mount.
 *  The trailing Z is not decoration — without it the string reads as local time and is
 *  wrong by however far the reader sits from Greenwich.
 *
 *  An unparseable value comes back untouched rather than as "Invalid Date". The field is
 *  a String in the SDL, so this is the one place that assumption is checked, and a
 *  diagnostic panel showing a strange timestamp is better than one showing nothing.
 */
export function formatUtc(iso: string): string {
  const at = new Date(iso);
  if (Number.isNaN(at.getTime())) return iso;
  return `${at.toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace("T", " ")}Z`;
}
EOF
cat > src/lib/formatUtc.test.ts <<'EOF'
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { formatUtc } from "./formatUtc";

test("renders an ISO instant as a UTC wall clock", () => {
  expect(formatUtc("2026-08-09T07:53:46.125Z")).toBe("2026-08-09 07:53:46Z");
});

// The reason the Z is in the output. A reader east of Greenwich seeing "07:53:46" with
// no zone reads their own clock and concludes the webhook landed hours ago.
test("keeps the instant in UTC rather than the running machine's zone", () => {
  expect(formatUtc("2026-08-09T23:30:00.000+08:00")).toBe(
    "2026-08-09 15:30:00Z",
  );
});

test("a value that is not a date is returned untouched, never Invalid Date", () => {
  expect(formatUtc("not a timestamp")).toBe("not a timestamp");
  expect(formatUtc("")).toBe("");
});
EOF
```

UTC rather than the visitor's zone is forced by the layer, not chosen for taste: the home
page is a server component, and an offset that only exists after mount is precisely the
hydration trap `project-ui` names. Spelling the zone out in the output is what keeps the value
honest for a reader who is not on UTC.

### The checkout route

The form is a client component because Stripe.js is a browser API; the page around it stays a
server component, so the only JavaScript this route ships is the wrapper and the loader.

```bash
mkdir -p src/app/checkout/return
cat > src/app/checkout/checkout-form.tsx <<'EOF'

  EmbeddedCheckoutProvider,

 *  follow the mode toggle, because embedded Checkout is styled from the account's

```

The return page is split in two, and the seam is a `<Suspense>` boundary rather than a
component-size preference. Stripe's iframe finishes by handing the browser a top-level
navigation, so until this Worker sends its first byte the visitor is still looking at the
payment form they have just completed — a web-to-API-to-Stripe round trip spent staring at
the thing they thought they were done with. Nothing above the boundary awaits, `searchParams`
is passed on as a promise rather than unwrapped, and the card paints in the first chunk while
only the sentence inside it waits. Measured against the production build on workerd: shell at
+0ms, outcome at +200ms.

The copy lives in `outcome.ts` as data, not JSX, for the reason the next paragraph gives — the
difference between two of those strings is the difference between thanking someone and telling
them their card was declined, and that is worth a test that needs no DOM. A `Record` keyed by
the generated enum keeps it exhaustive: a fourth `CheckoutStatus` stops the file compiling.

`OPEN` is a state the hosted flow did not have to render: there, a visitor who abandoned or
had a card declined came back through `cancel_url`. Embedded has no `cancel_url`, so a decline
lands here with the session still open — and a page that said "payment sent" to a declined
card would be a wrong statement on screen, which is the one thing this project's UI rules do
not tolerate.

The home page keeps the status panel and gains a link, not a form — starting checkout is now
navigation, and the payment happens on the route it goes to:

The same enum decision has to be made on this side too — the two presets do not share a
config, and a TS enum here would mean importing a generated value into the page just to write
three equality checks:

```diff
--- apps/web/codegen.ts
-      config: { documentMode: "string" },
+      // enumsAsTypes mirrors apps/graphql's setting. The two configs are independent, so
+      // this is a decision made twice rather than one inherited; setting it on only one
+      // side gives a resolver returning "COMPLETE" and a page comparing an enum member.
+      config: { documentMode: "string", enumsAsTypes: true },
```

```bash
pnpm turbo codegen --filter @web-app-scaffold/web
```

## Local gate

Docker up, both dev servers running, and the Stripe CLI forwarding — `USER-SETUP.md` §3
installs it and links it to the right sandbox.

```bash
cd ../..
stripe listen --events checkout.session.completed \
  --forward-to localhost:8787/stripe/webhook
```

`--events`, and not a bare `stripe listen`, for the reason step 4 subscribes the deployed
endpoint to one type: without it the CLI forwards everything, and one
`stripe trigger checkout.session.completed` is a six-event cascade —
`charge.succeeded`, two `payment_intent.*`, the session, then `charge.updated` a few seconds
later. All six are recorded, because this handler is deliberately type-agnostic, so the
newest row is `charge.updated` and the table below would read as a failure when nothing
failed. Filtering here makes local match production.

It prints `Your webhook signing secret is whsec_…`. Put that in `apps/graphql/.env.development` and
**restart `wrangler dev`** — the env file is read at startup, so a running Worker keeps the
old value and rejects every delivery with a 400 that looks exactly like a real forgery.

**Better: take the secret before either process starts.** `stripe listen --print-secret`
prints the same value without opening a forwarder, because the CLI's secret is stable per
account and device rather than per run. Writing it into `.env.development` first and only then
starting `wrangler dev` removes the restart step and the 400 that follows forgetting it:

```bash
stripe listen --print-secret        # whsec_… — the same value every run
```

Forward to `:8787` and not `:3000`: the webhook goes to the API Worker directly, which is the
whole point of it not being behind the proxy.

`:8787` is also not negotiable: `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` hardcodes it for `next dev`, so a
second `wrangler dev` already holding the port sends this one to `:8788` and the browser
keeps talking to the stale Worker while every delivery lands nowhere. If deliveries vanish,
check `ss -ltnp | grep 8787` names the Worker you just started.

| root       | **`pnpm test:unit`**                                   | graphql **24**, web **27**, email **8** — from a measured 16 / 15 / 8 |
| root       | **`pnpm test:integration`**                            | db **1**, graphql **7** — from a measured 1 / 5                       |

**The two card-entry rows are not on this table, and that is deliberate.** Paying with
`4242 4242 4242 4242` and being declined with `4000 0000 0000 9995` are Round 3 steps handed
to a person: this skill's own rule is never to enter a payment detail itself, test card or
not. They are not lost — everything they would prove about the _return page_ is provable
without a card, which is what the two `checkout/return?session_id=` rows above do. A
`stripe trigger` produces a real `complete` session, and any session created and abandoned is
`open`; loading the return page with each id exercises `checkoutSessionStatus`, the enum
mapping and both copy branches. What only a card proves is Stripe's own form submitting, and
that is the part a person should watch anyway.

**The baseline above was measured in this repo before a line of this slice was written**, on
2026-09-06: `pnpm test:unit` gave web 15, email 8, graphql 16, and `pnpm test:integration` gave
db 1, graphql 5. `pnpm lint` gave `6 successful`. The numbers in the table are those plus what
this slice's own files hold — graphql +8 (`stripe` 3, `stripe-webhook` 5), web +12 (`stripe` 3,
`actions` 2, `formatUtc` 3, `outcome` 4), integration +2. Counted from the files, not inherited.

**Measure the baseline before running any of this, and do not inherit a total.** Earlier
versions of this slice carried absolute figures that were wrong twice over: they assumed a
Slice 6 leaving 40 unit tests where a real one left 39, and they counted this slice's own new
web tests as 8 when the files it writes hold 12 (`stripe` 3, `actions` 2, `formatUtc` 3,
`outcome` 4). A gate whose number is wrong is worse than one with no number, because the run
that matches it is indistinguishable from the run that does not.

Row ten is the one worth doing by hand. Every other row exercises the happy path with a
correct signature attached by Stripe's own tooling; this is the only one that asks what
happens when someone posts to a public URL that writes to your database. Row eleven is its
counterpart for the new public read: `checkoutSessionStatus` takes an id from a stranger.

Rows eight and nine are the pair. A webhook handler that records duplicates looks identical to
a correct one until Stripe's first retry, which happens on their schedule and not yours.

Row seven is new to embedded and cannot be skipped. With no `cancel_url`, a declined card is
the only way to reach the `OPEN` branch of the return page, and that branch is the one that
would otherwise tell someone their failed payment succeeded.

**What this run actually saw in the iframe.** A **Choose currency** selector above the form,
`SGD 25.02` preselected beside `US$19.00`, with `1 USD = 1.3168 SGD` underneath. That is
Stripe's `adaptive_pricing`, on by default, and the sandbox account's country is Singapore. The
session is unaffected — `amount_total` is the `1900` USD cents the resolver sends — so this is
presentation, not a wrong amount. `adaptive_pricing: { enabled: false }` on the session turns it
off if a single currency ever matters more than local pricing here.

**Round 1, as it actually ran on 2026-09-06.** Everything below passed. Worth recording:

- Unit `pnpm test:unit`: graphql **24**, web **27**, email **8** — the predicted numbers exactly.
  Integration: db **1**, graphql **7**. `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` both `6 successful`.
- The migration was one `CREATE TABLE stripe_event` and no `ALTER`, read before applying.
- `stripe trigger` with `--events checkout.session.completed` produced exactly one delivery and
  one row — the filter doing its job; a bare `stripe listen` would have recorded the whole
  six-event cascade and left `charge.updated` newest.
- `stripe events resend` needed no `--webhook-endpoint`: with `stripe listen` running it
  re-delivered through the forwarder. Second `200`, still one row, `received_at` unchanged at
  `05:52:46.79226+00`. That is the idempotency proof, a round earlier than the plan expected it.
- The three refusal rows: unsigned `400`, forged signature `400`, `GET` `405`, nothing written.
- All four return-page branches rendered from real session ids with no card typed — `COMPLETE`,
  `OPEN`, and the red `UNREADABLE` for `cs_test_nonsense`.
- Under `pnpm preview` the form area sat empty for about **17 seconds**, not the five the
  reference predicted, then mounted correctly. The console carried only Stripe's
  "You may test your Stripe.js integration over HTTP" notice — which is how you tell that delay
  from a failure.
- The fresh-clone run passed identically with no `.env.*` files present: `6 successful` on
  typecheck and lint, and the same 24 / 27 / 8.
- `docs:check` initially reported ten drifts. Nine were prettier reflow of this plan's own
  heredocs, and prettier owns formatting, so the heredocs were resynced from the formatted
  source. The tenth was a genuinely stale hunk context — corrected here and upstream in the
  skill.

Three things will look wrong and are not. The form does not follow the mode toggle — it is
Stripe's iframe, themed from the account's dashboard branding, not from `theme.css`.
`view-source` on `/checkout` shows the `pk_test_…` key inline; that is what a publishable key
is for. And under `pnpm preview` the card paints with an **empty** form area for several
seconds before the iframe mounts — measured at roughly five under workerd, against under one
in `next dev`. That is latency, not the "fails blank" failure: check the console before
chasing it, because a real key or session failure logs there and this does not.

`preview` runs on port 3000 with `next dev` stopped, for Slice 6's reason: `WEB_ORIGIN` names
`localhost:3000`, and the return URL is built from whatever that says.

Then rerun in a fresh `git clone` with no `.env.development`. This slice adds two Worker secrets, one
build-time public var, and a rename, which is exactly the shape of change that passes only on
the machine that made it — `wrangler types` reads your local env file, so `WorkerEnv` carries
the new keys for you and not for the clone, and `next build` inlines a publishable key the
clone does not have.

## Production gate

Steps 1–4 run once per environment. Steps 5–7 are the gate and re-run on every later deploy
that touches payments.

Every step carries its own `cd` from the repo root rather than relying on one at the top.
`wrangler` and `drizzle-kit` are devDependencies of their packages, so from the root both fail
with `Command not found`; and each reads its config from the working directory, so the
directory decides which Worker a secret attaches to and which database a migration runs
against.

**Stay in test mode for this gate.** Every step below works identically in live mode and
charges a real card at step 7, which is not what a pipeline proof is for.

### 1. Stripe account and API keys — one time

`USER-SETUP.md` §1–2: the signup, and why this slice needs **both** the `sk_test_` and the
`pk_test_` key where a hosted integration needs only one.

### 2. `WEB_ORIGIN`, `STRIPE_MODE`, and the publishable key — one time

`wrangler.jsonc` ships the slice author's account subdomain, and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is gone.
Make both yours:

```jsonc
"WEB_ORIGIN": "https://web-app-scaffold-web.yoursubdomain.workers.dev",
"STRIPE_MODE": "test"
```

The **web** origin, never this Worker's — it is what Better Auth validates the browser's
`Origin` against, what the verification link is built from, and now where Checkout returns.
Both are `vars`, so they take a redeploy: do this before step 6.

The publishable key does not live here at all. It is a build input, and it goes in the file
the _production_ build reads:

```bash
cd apps/web
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_…' >> .env.production
```

`.env.production`, not `.env.development`: `deploy:production` runs `next build`, which is
mode `production`. Both files carry a `pk_test_` key while this gate stays in test mode, so
they agree — but they are read by different commands, and only this one reaches a deploy.

Both are gitignored. **This is the one credential in the repo that a deploy cannot change** —
it is compiled into the bundle, so rotating it means rebuilding and redeploying web, not
`wrangler secret put`. And because `pnpm preview` is also a production build, it reads this
same file: keep a live key out of it, or the next `pnpm preview` mounts a real payment form
on `localhost`. A live key belongs to whatever runs the deploy, which is CI's job and not a
working copy's.

### 3. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — one time, again only to rotate

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY   # paste the sk_test_… key at the prompt
```

`secret put` also reads **stdin**, which is the better form while the gate is in test mode: it
keeps the key out of the terminal, out of scrollback and out of the clipboard. Pair it with a
guard that asserts the mode rather than trusting it, so a live key cannot flow through even by
accident — the difference between promising not to touch one and making it impossible
(SKILL.md §6). `--env-file .env.production` is what points wrangler at the right Cloudflare
account, exactly as `deploy:production` does.

Interactive because the key is never a file, a flag, or a `vars` entry. Cloudflare stores it
against the Worker and **`wrangler deploy` does not clear it** — do not re-run this before
each deploy. `pnpm wrangler secret list` confirms it without revealing it.

Rotate it in Stripe's dashboard, not here, and then re-run this. A key with `sk_live_` in it
will not start the Worker while step 2 says `test`, which is the guard working.

### 4. The webhook endpoint and its secret — one time

Two settings decide whether this endpoint works, and the dashboard's form asks for them in
two different places: the URL must name the **API** Worker, and the event list must hold
exactly one entry. The CLI states both on one line, which is why it is the path given here —
the same `stripe` binary the local gate already uses, no `listen` involved.

```bash
stripe webhook_endpoints create \
  --url https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.yoursubdomain.workers.dev/stripe/webhook \
  --enabled-events checkout.session.completed \
  --description "web-app-scaffold — Slice 7"
```

`web-app-scaffold-graphql`, not `web-app-scaffold-web`: the webhook does not go through the proxy, for the
reason at the top of this slice. And one `--enabled-events`, not `'*'` — a subscription to
everything delivers account-lifecycle noise to a handler that records each item forever, and
this list is the cheapest place to say what the endpoint is for.

Everything the command does **not** say is a default, and each one is a setting:

| Setting         | What you get                    | Why that is right here                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mode            | **test** — `--live` switches it | matches step 2's `STRIPE_MODE` and step 3's `sk_test_` key. A live endpoint over a test Worker never delivers anything                         |
| account         | whatever `stripe login` linked  | must be the sandbox step 1's keys came from — see below                                                                                        |
| `--connect`     | omitted → `false`               | events from your own account. `true` is the Connect variant, and delivers other accounts' events to a handler with no notion of whose they are |
| `--api-version` | omitted → the account's default | pinning a version here means payloads stop matching the `stripe` package's types the day the SDK is upgraded                                   |
| status          | enabled                         | there is nothing to switch on afterwards                                                                                                       |

**The account is the one thing the command cannot tell you it got wrong.** `stripe login`
links one account or sandbox, and if step 1's keys came from a different one the endpoint is
created somewhere real — it just is not the somewhere your Worker's secret key belongs to,
and nothing fails until deliveries never arrive. Check before and after:

```bash
stripe config --list                    # which account this CLI is linked to
stripe webhook_endpoints list           # what now exists on it
```

`list` is also the guard against the second-worst outcome: running the create twice leaves
**two** endpoints on the same URL, both delivering, and the secret you stored matches only
one. Every other delivery then fails signature verification, which reads as intermittent
forgery. If you see two, `stripe webhook_endpoints delete we_…` the extra one.

The create response is the `whsec_…`:

```json
{
  "id": "we_1Mr5…",
  "enabled_events": ["checkout.session.completed"],
  "livemode": false,
  "secret": "whsec_…",
  "status": "enabled",
  "url": "https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.…workers.dev/stripe/webhook"
}
```

**This response is the only place the API ever shows it.** A later `webhook_endpoints
retrieve` returns the object without `secret`; only the dashboard's endpoint page will reveal
it again. So put it somewhere durable before moving on:

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET   # paste the whsec_… at the prompt
```

Or skip the clipboard entirely — `wrangler secret put` reads stdin, and the output above is
plain JSON with `--color off`:

```bash
stripe webhook_endpoints create --color off --confirm \
  --url https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.yoursubdomain.workers.dev/stripe/webhook \
  --enabled-events checkout.session.completed \
| jq -r .secret \
| pnpm wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET --cwd apps/graphql
```

Run from the repo root — `--cwd` is what points wrangler at the API Worker's config, doing
the job the `cd` does in the two-step version. Worth it beyond the typing saved: the secret
never lands in a terminal buffer, a clipboard, or scrollback.

<details>
<summary>Doing it in the dashboard instead — every field</summary>

Developers → Webhooks → **Add endpoint**, with the test/live toggle set to **test**:

| Field          | Set it to                                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endpoint URL   | `https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.yoursubdomain.workers.dev/stripe/webhook` |
| Listen to      | **Events on your account** — not "Events on Connected accounts"             |
| Events to send | `checkout.session.completed`, and nothing else                              |
| Version        | leave on the account's default API version                                  |
| Description    | anything; it is a label                                                     |

Then **Reveal** the signing secret on the endpoint's page and `wrangler secret put` it as
above. The dashboard is also where you come back if the secret is ever lost.

</details>

**The `whsec_…` here is a different secret from the one `stripe listen` printed.** The CLI's
belongs to your machine and its account — stable across runs, and recoverable with
`stripe listen --print-secret`; this one belongs to the registered endpoint. Swapping them
gives a 400 on every delivery that reads exactly like a forgery.

Registering before the deploy is fine. Anything Stripe sends first gets a 404 and is retried
— which is the retry behaviour this slice depends on, arriving early.

### 5. Migrate — re-runnable; the first run creates one table

```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm migrate:production
```

Before the deploy, not after: the deployed handler inserts into `stripe_event` on the first
delivery. `:production` selects `.env.production` and Neon's direct URL — a migration never
goes through Hyperdrive. Idempotent; drizzle records what it has applied.

### 6. Deploy — re-runnable, API first

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler deploy --dry-run
pnpm deploy:production
cd ../web
pnpm deploy:production
```

**API first is a hard constraint**: web's `API` binding resolves at upload time. Web redeploys
too — the routes, the action, and the inlined publishable key are all new.

Read the dry run's figure before deploying. Slice 6 left the API bundle well under
Cloudflare's 3 MiB gzipped ceiling and said to measure the next addition; the Stripe SDK is a
larger dependency than better-auth, so record what it costs here rather than discovering the
ceiling at upload. Web's bundle grows too, but only by the React wrapper — Stripe.js itself is
fetched from `js.stripe.com` at runtime and is never in it.

### 7. Observe — re-runnable, each pass creates a real Checkout Session

On the deployed **web** URL, never the API's.

| Check                                                      | Expect                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buy the test item**                                      | Stripe's form inline on your own origin, showing `$19.00` |
| the page's URL, while the form is up                       | your web origin — never `checkout.stripe.com`             |
| the form's footer                                          | a **TEST MODE** indication                                |
| pay with `4242 4242 4242 4242`                             | `/checkout/return`, "Payment sent"                        |
| **Back to **PROJECT****                                    | `last stripe event` reads `checkout.session.completed`    |
| `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`                | Stripe delivers to the **deployed** endpoint; one new row |
| `stripe events resend <evt_…> --webhook-endpoint <we_…>`   | still **one** row, and `receivedAt` **unchanged**         |
| `curl -X POST https://…workers.dev/stripe/webhook -d '{}'` | `400 Invalid signature`                                   |
| **Buy the test item**, pay with `4000 0000 0000 9995`      | declined inline; no new event row                         |

**Hyperdrive caches reads, so the row will not appear when you first look.** Its query cache
is on by default with a 60-second TTL, and the gate's shape — read `stripeEvents`, deliver an
event, read it again — is exactly the shape that gets a stale answer: the second read is served
from the first. On this run that produced an empty list for a full minute after a delivery that
had returned `200`, which reads exactly like a webhook that wrote nothing.

`wrangler tail` is what settled it, and it is the thing to reach for first: a
`POST /stripe/webhook` with `"outcome":"ok"`, status `200` and no `console.error` means
verification passed and the insert ran, whatever the query says. The row was there the whole
time. `caching: { disabled: true }` on the Hyperdrive binding is the opt-out if a stale read
ever matters more here than the pooling, but it was not changed for this — turning the cache
off to make a gate read faster is optimising the wrong thing.

The resend row is the one that could not be proven locally against the real endpoint secret,
and it is the difference between a handler that is idempotent and one that has not been asked
yet. Prefer the CLI's `--webhook-endpoint` form over the dashboard's Resend button: it names
which endpoint it is retrying and prints the event it sent, so a silent no-op cannot be
mistaken for a passing row. **Read `receivedAt`, not just the row count** — a handler that
deleted and re-inserted would also show one row, and only an unchanged timestamp rules that
out. The `curl` row proves the same thing the local gate did, against the URL that is actually
public.

**`stripe trigger` fans out to every endpoint on the account subscribed to that event**, not
only this project's. If the account carries endpoints for other projects they receive it too —
harmless in test mode, but worth knowing before wondering why another project grew a row.

### The two rows only a person can run

Filling Stripe's embedded form is not something the agent can do: the fields live in a
cross-origin `js.stripe.com` iframe, absent from the accessibility tree, and coordinate-based
clicking does not focus them. A tooling limit, not a policy one (SKILL.md §6).

| Check                                            | Expect                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buy the test item**, pay `4242 4242 4242 4242` | `/checkout/return`, "Thank you"; a new row on the home card |
| **Buy the test item**, pay `4000 0000 0000 9995` | declined inline; no new event row                           |

Everything those two would prove about the _return page_ is already covered above by loading it
with a real session id, so what rests on them is narrow: that Stripe's own form submits and
redirects.

Row two is the row this slice's change exists for. If the address bar ever reads

```bash
cd apps/graphql
pnpm wrangler tail        # then resend a delivery from the dashboard
```

That separates "the handler threw" from "Stripe never delivered". Stripe's own delivery log
answers the second half — it records every attempt, its response code, and its body.

**Round 2, as it actually ran on 2026-09-06.** Against the sandbox Stripe account and
the deploying Cloudflare account:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` both moved by pipe from the Stripe CLI config
  and the endpoint-create response respectively, each behind an assertion, neither rendered.
  `wrangler secret list` now shows four secrets on `web-app-scaffold-graphql`.
- Endpoint `we_1UCZ8eBnLSnWkEcoWS7IM8p1` → `https://web-app-scaffold-graphql.yoursubdomain.workers.dev/stripe/webhook`,
  `livemode: false`, one enabled event, status enabled. `webhook_endpoints list` was checked
  before and after: one pre-existing endpoint on this account belongs to an unrelated project
  (`nanostore-graphql`) at a different URL, so no double-delivery here — but it does receive the
  same `stripe trigger` events, exactly as this slice warns.
- API bundle: **5236.13 KiB raw / 941.44 KiB gzipped**, against the 3 MiB gzipped ceiling.
- `pnpm migrate:production` before the deploy; API deployed, then web.
- The delivery returned `200` and wrote one row, but the read-back showed `[]` for a minute —
  the Hyperdrive cache, above. `wrangler tail` showed `"outcome":"ok"` with no error logs.
- `stripe events resend --webhook-endpoint`: still **one** row, `receivedAt` unchanged at
  `2026-09-06T06:02:48.624Z`.
- Unsigned `POST` → `400`, `GET` → `405`, against the real public URL.
- The deployed `/checkout` renders Stripe's form inline on `web-app-scaffold-web.yoursubdomain.workers.dev`,
  TEST MODE, `US$19.00` beside `SGD 25.03` — never `checkout.stripe.com`.

Commit.

**Left for later, deliberately.** This slice records that an event arrived; it does not act on
one. Fulfilment — reading the session back with `line_items` expanded, checking
`payment_status`, and marking an order — is a vertical slice, and so are a `Customer` per
signed-in user, subscriptions, `automatic_tax`, and dashboard branding so the iframe stops
being the one light-mode rectangle in a dark page. Also left: `redirect_on_completion: "never"`
with an `onComplete` callback, which keeps the visitor on `/checkout` for the whole flow and
is worth having once there is something to show them that is not just a webhook's shadow. And
the handler does its database write inline, so a slow Postgres is a slow webhook response — a
queue between the two is a binding with its own pipeline, which makes it a horizontal slice.

## The operating manual

Payments span `packages/db`, `apps/graphql` and `apps/web`, like auth, so they get a skill
rather than three sets of bullets. The new skill is a heredoc; the pointers are deltas.

description: Work with Stripe in web-app-scaffold — embedded Checkout Sessions from apps/graphql, the form mounted in apps/web, the signed webhook at /stripe/webhook, and the stripe_event table in packages/db. Use when a feature takes money, when a Stripe event must be acted on, or when the Stripe configuration changes.
---

# payments — Stripe, across three layers

## Shape

Checkout is **embedded**: Stripe's form runs in an iframe on our own origin, and the
browser never navigates to Stripe.

```
apps/web  ──server action──▶ apps/graphql ──▶ Stripe API     (create a session)
          ◀──────── client secret ◀───────────────────────
browser   ──▶ js.stripe.com ──▶ iframe mounted on our page
Stripe    ──POST /stripe/webhook────────────▶ apps/graphql ──▶ Postgres
```

`/stripe/webhook` is on the **API** Worker's own public URL, routed in `src/index.ts` ahead
of Yoga. It is deliberately _not_ behind apps/web's auth proxy: that proxy exists so a
cookie can belong to the browser's origin, and a webhook has no cookie, no Origin, and
nothing to gain from a hop that can re-encode the bytes the signature covers.

## Owns / never touches

- **Owns:** `apps/graphql/src/stripe.ts` (client factory + mode guard),
  `src/stripe-webhook.ts` (verification + recording), `src/schema/payments/**`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/stripe.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/checkout/**`, and `stripeEvent` in
  `packages/db/src/schema.ts`.
- **`apps/web` never imports `stripe`** — the server SDK. It _does_ import
  `@stripe/stripe-js` and `@stripe/react-stripe-js`, which are the browser half and hold
  no secret. The distinction is the whole security boundary: the secret key and the
  database binding are in `apps/graphql` and stay there.
- **Never act on a Stripe object the client sent you.** A session id in a query string is a
  claim. Read it back from Stripe's API — as `checkoutSessionStatus` does — or take it
  from a verified event.
- **Never branch on `event.type` in the handler** without deciding what happens to every
  other type. Recording is type-agnostic on purpose; fulfilment is not.

## Embedded Checkout, and what the mode implies

- **`ui_mode: "embedded_page"`** — not `"embedded"`, which the API rejects outright with
  _"no longer supported. Use `embedded_page` instead."_ It is what makes `client_secret`
  present and `url` absent. Re-verified against the live API 2026-09-06.
- **There is no `cancel_url`.** The API rejects it on an embedded session. Everything comes
  back through `return_url`, so the return page must handle `OPEN` — a declined card — and
  not assume it means success.
- **`return_url` carries `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`**, which Stripe substitutes. Anything the
  return page says about that id must be read back from Stripe first.
- **`fetchClientSecret`, not a rendered `clientSecret`.** A secret in the page means a
  session created for every visitor who loads the route, and no way to get a fresh one
  when the visitor retries.
- **`loadStripe` at module scope, exactly once.** It injects a script tag; calling it in a
  render re-runs that. Stripe.js is loaded from `js.stripe.com` and is never bundled or
  self-hosted — that is a PCI posture, not a performance choice.
- The iframe does not inherit `theme.css` and will not follow the mode toggle. Embedded
  Checkout is styled from the account's dashboard branding settings.
- Under `pnpm preview` the form area sits **empty for about five seconds** before the iframe
  mounts. That is latency, not failure — a real key or session error logs to the console.

## The webhook, and the four things that break it

1. **Read the body once, as text, before anything parses it.** The signature covers the
   exact bytes. `request.json()` consumes the body, re-serialising gives different bytes,
   and a second read on a Workers `Request` throws.
2. **`constructEventAsync`, never `constructEvent`.** WebCrypto is async, so the sync form
   cannot work on workerd. The provider is `Stripe.createSubtleCryptoProvider()`, passed
   as the fifth argument — the fourth is the tolerance, left `undefined`.
3. **Idempotency is the primary key, not a lookup.** Insert with `onConflictDoNothing()` and
   read the returned rows. Stripe retries, and can deliver the same event concurrently, so
   a "have I seen this?" read has a window that a conflict does not.
4. **Reject with 4xx, never 5xx.** Stripe retries a 5xx for days. A body that failed
   verification will fail it every time; a duplicate is a success, so it answers 200 too.

## Keys and modes

| Value                                | Kind        | Where                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STRIPE_MODE`                        | var         | `wrangler.jsonc`, `.env.development` — `test` or `live` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`                  | secret      | `wrangler secret put`, `.env.development`               |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`              | secret      | `wrangler secret put`, `.env.development`               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | build input | `apps/web/.env.development` + `.env.production`         |

- **`createStripe(env)` is per request.** Never hoist it: secrets do not exist at import
  time on a Worker.
- **`httpClient: Stripe.createFetchHttpClient()` is named on purpose, not required.** Since
  `stripe` 22 the `workerd` export condition already resolves to a build whose default
  client is fetch and whose default crypto provider is SubtleCrypto. Naming both keeps this
  Worker correct without depending on export-condition resolution — and the node build it
  would otherwise fall back to reaches for `node:https`, failing at the first API call
  rather than at import.
- **The API's mode is named, not inferred.** `assertKeyMatchesMode` refuses a `sk_live_` key
  under `STRIPE_MODE=test` and the reverse. Deleting that check makes a live key in a dev
  deploy a silent, chargeable success.
- **Web checks its key's shape, not its mode.** A `pk_live_` in a test build fails loudly and
  charges nothing; an `sk_` in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` var is published to every visitor.
  `assertPublishableKey` catches the second and never echoes the value.
- **The publishable key is the one credential a deploy cannot change.** It is compiled in,
  so rotating it is a rebuild of `apps/web`, not `wrangler secret put`. It is read from
  `.env.production` by `pnpm preview` as well as by `deploy:production` — keep a live key
  out of a working copy, or the next preview mounts a real payment form on localhost.
- **The local `whsec_` and the deployed one are different secrets.** The CLI's belongs to
  your machine and account and is stable across runs — `stripe listen --print-secret` prints
  it, and taking it that way _before_ starting `wrangler dev` avoids a restart; the deployed
  endpoint has its own, returned once by `stripe webhook_endpoints create` and re-revealable
  only from that endpoint's dashboard page. Swapping them gives a 400 that reads exactly
  like a forgery.
- **Local development pins port 8787.** `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` hardcodes it for `next dev`
  and `stripe listen` forwards to it, so a second `wrangler dev` holding the port pushes the
  new one to 8788 — and the browser keeps talking to the stale Worker while deliveries land
  nowhere. Vanished deliveries: check `ss -ltnp | grep 8787`.
- **`stripe listen --events checkout.session.completed`**, mirroring the deployed
  subscription. A bare `stripe listen` forwards the whole cascade a trigger produces, and
  since the handler records every type, the newest row ends up `charge.updated`.
- The SDK pins its own Stripe API version. Upgrading `stripe` moves it — read the changelog
  rather than the diff.

## Judgment calls

- **The return page proves nothing.** It means the browser came back; a visitor can pay and
  close the tab. Only the webhook is evidence that money moved.
- **Money is integer cents, everywhere**, and `formatPrice` is the only thing that renders
  it. Nothing in a money path is a float.
- Inline `price_data` keeps the amount in the repo. Reach for a dashboard Price when a
  human needs to change it without a deploy, and accept that it is then untracked.
- **A public list field needs a server-side ceiling.** The SDL's `limit: Int! = 5` is a
  default, not a limit; `stripeEvents` clamps it.
- **A public field that takes a Stripe id is an oracle.** `checkoutSessionStatus` returns a
  status and nothing else on purpose — adding the customer's email would make it worth
  attacking.
- **Resolvers reach drizzle through `@web-app-scaffold/db`, never `drizzle-orm` directly.** That
  package is not a dependency of `apps/graphql` and should not become one — `packages/db`
  owns the version, and its `index.ts` re-exports the operators (`eq`, `desc`, …).
- **Testing the return page needs no card.** A `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`
  leaves a real `complete` session and any abandoned session is `open`; loading
  `/checkout/return?session_id=…` with each exercises every branch.
- **An agent cannot fill the embedded form.** The fields are in a cross-origin
  `js.stripe.com` iframe, so they never enter the accessibility tree and coordinate clicks do
  not focus them. Card entry is a human step; everything else is reachable through the CLI.
- **Prove a deployed webhook with `stripe trigger`, then `stripe events resend <evt>
--webhook-endpoint <we>`.** The first exercises the real endpoint secret end to end, the
  second is the idempotency check. Read `receivedAt`, not just the row count — a delete-and
  -reinsert bug also leaves one row, and only an unchanged timestamp rules it out. Note that
  a trigger fans out to every endpoint on the account subscribed to that event.
- **Move a test key with a pipe and a guard, never a paste.** `wrangler secret put` reads
  stdin, so a `sk_test_` key can go from the local Stripe config straight to Cloudflare
  without touching a terminal or clipboard — behind a check that exits non-zero on anything
  without `_test_`. A live key is never handled this way, or any way.

## Enforced elsewhere

- `apps/graphql/src/stripe.test.ts` pins the mode guard in both directions, including an
  unset mode.
- `apps/graphql/src/stripe-webhook.test.ts` pins the routing switch and every refusal path:
  wrong method, no signature, bad signature — all without a database binding, so a handler
  that reached one would throw instead of returning the asserted status.
- `apps/graphql/src/stripe-webhook.int.test.ts` drives a correctly signed delivery, its
  retry, and a tampered body against real Postgres. Needs `docker compose up -d`.
- `apps/web/src/lib/stripe.test.ts` pins that a secret key in the public var is refused.
  `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` supplies a dummy `pk_test_` to the unit project — that module
  guards its own `loadStripe` call at import, so without one it throws before collection.
- `apps/web/src/app/actions.test.ts` pins that a failed session rejects without surfacing
  the API's message.
- `apps/web/src/lib/formatUtc.test.ts` pins that the event time stays in UTC rather than the
  running machine's zone, and that an unparseable value is never rendered as `Invalid Date`.

The `project-db` skill owns the tables, so it says which one is Stripe's and why its key is what it
is:

```diff
--- .claude/skills/project-db/SKILL.md
 - **Never:** `apps/web` must not import `@web-app-scaffold/db` — only the API Worker does. The
   dependency graph is the architecture; web reaches data through the API or not at all.

+  adding a second direct dependency — one owner, one version.
```

The `graphql` skill gains the third thing this Worker serves, and the var rename:

```diff
--- .claude/skills/project-graphql/SKILL.md

The `web` skill gains server actions and the third-party script, which are both new here:

```diff
--- .claude/skills/project-web/SKILL.md
 - **`src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` is a transparent proxy to the API Worker**, and the

## The docs:check baseline

`apps/web/.env.development` now holds an account-specific credential appended by hand, which
is exactly the situation `apps/graphql/.env.development` has been in since Slice 5. No doc can
write it whole again without either overwriting your key or committing one, so this slice
baselines it — and per that file's own rule, the entry is added by the slice that makes it
true rather than in advance.

```diff
--- scripts/docs-check.ignore

+# keys go, but it is still yours — a heredoc would either overwrite it or commit one.

```

## Sources

The documentation this slice's §3 research rests on — kept here rather than in a shared
bibliography, so that reading the slice is reading its evidence. **Re-check rather than
inherit:** a source is only as good as the day it was read, and the version pins in this slice
are claims about a registry that moves. `changelog/` records what changed here and why.

- [Stripe webhooks quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) (`stripe listen`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- [Stripe webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) (signature verification, automatic retries, 4xx vs 5xx)
- [Fulfil orders with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment) (why the webhook and not the redirect, and the 10-second wait)
- [Create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create) (`mode`, inline `price_data`, `success_url`)
- [stripe-node](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node) (`createFetchHttpClient`, `createSubtleCryptoProvider`, `constructEventAsync`)
- [Stripe SDK on Cloudflare Workers · OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/stripeAPI) (why the default `node:https` client does not work)
- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) (`stripe listen`, `stripe trigger`)
- [Next.js server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/updating-data) (a form `action`, and `redirect` outside `try`)

## Leaves behind

Read by Slice 99 (the audit), which treats this as a **cross-check and never as the source of truth** —
the code is that. An entry here is a claim about the repo; where the two disagree, the code
wins and this table is the finding.

**Provisional** is something built to prove a mechanism, with the condition that retires it.
**Accepted** is a risk taken knowingly, with the reasoning written down so a later slice can
re-decide it rather than rediscover it.

> **Not yet verified by a run.** This block was written by reading the slice, not by executing
> it. Slice 99 should treat every row as unconfirmed and check it against the code first.

### Provisional

Nothing new. `sendTestEmail` still survives, and this slice is where it starts being described
as permanent architecture — which is the point at which it stops looking provisional to a reader.

### Accepted

| Risk                                                     | Reachable by        | Why this is the right trade                                                                                                                                                         |

| `POST /stripe/webhook` is public and unauthenticated     | The entire internet | It must be: Stripe has no cookie and no origin. `constructEventAsync` verifying the signature is the authentication, and the `stripe_event` primary key is what makes replay inert. |
| Prices are inline `price_data`, set by the caller's code | —                   | The amount lives in the repo as integer cents rather than in a dashboard no doc can check. It is server-side; confirm no client input reaches it.                                   |
